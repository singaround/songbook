***The One Page Songbook****

We wanted a way to put all the Auntie Shanty shanties onto a single static page. This will allow people to save a copy locally for printing or for singing when they’ve not got internet access.

We’ve not yet found a good way of doing this, but have developed a workaround which uses Excel and PowerQuery to generate the script for an HTML document. 

It’s a semi-automated process – takes about 5 minutes. It is included here for reference.

**Instructions**

Download the Excel document “AS_OnePageMaker.xlsx”

Open the Excel document, and allow scripts to run when prompted.

Create a HTML document. The HTML document will need to be opened in such a way that you can edit it.

Prepare the HTML document. The document must include the following four things, in this order

1)	The text from cell A1 of the ‘header’ sheet
2)	Contents of column M of the ‘full table’ sheet, excluding the header (the table of contents)
3)	Contents of column L of the ‘full table’ sheet, excluding the header (this is the songs)
4)	The text from cell A1 of the ‘footer’ sheet

Then (IMPORTANT). In your HTML text editor, use find-and-replace to replace all instances of double speech marks (“”) with single speech marks (“).

Then (IMPORTANT) edit the ‘####date####’ in the header section to today’s date. This is free text, so you might want to add a note here – so it could say “25/12/26 – downloaded for Christmas party”, for example.

Save the HTML document.
