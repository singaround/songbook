If you'd like to add more songs, improve the site (please get involved, especially if you're a front end developer!), or generally help out in some way, we'd really appreciate it.

In preparation for the first session with a songbook, we've written an FAQ over at the [about](about) page. We based this on Hannah's original vision, and also tried to include all the points raised last time when we talked about uncomfortable experiences at other sessions and how we can make Auntie as welcoming as possible. Feedback on the FAQ is welcome, perhaps via the [contact](contact) page, or in person at a session if you like.

Hurrah, m'hearties, let's sing!
