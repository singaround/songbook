#### Looking for a song on a particular subject? – click a link

We’ve got loads of songs about **[seafaring women](/tags/seafaring_women/)**, both real and fictional. Women who have inspired more than one song include **[Grace O’Malley](/tags/grace_omalley/)** and **[Jeanne de Clisson](/tags/jeanne_de_clisson/)**.

We’ve got songs written by **[women, non-binary people and others who are not men](/tags/non-male_writer/)**, songs **[narrated by non-male characters](/tags/non-male_narrator/)**, and songs including **[women who don’t go to sea](/tags/women_on_the_shore/)**.

We’ve got songs that we consider to be overtly **[feminist](/tags/feminist/)** in their outlook, and those that we consider to have **[LGBTQ+ themes](/tags/lgbtq_plus/)**. We’ve also got songs with **[African or African-American origins](/tags/african_or_african-american_origin/)**.

You can view songs based on what the people are doing at sea – songs about **[fishing](/tags/fishing/)**, **[whaling](/tags/whaling/)**, **[saving lives](/tags/lifeboats/)**, **[trading and transport](/tags/maritime_trade/)**, and of course, **[rebellion](/tags/rebellion/)** and **[piracy](/tags/piracy/)** (Yarrrrr!). 

We’ve got songs about **[naval warfare](/tags/naval_warfare)**, the **[Royal Navy](/tags/Royal__Navy)**, and songs about **[being press-ganged](/tags/impressment)** into the navy (or trying to avoid it). 

There are songs with **[loads of joining-in bits](/tags/more_chorus_than_verse)** (choruses and/or repeated lines). The opposite of these are the **[ballads](/tags/ballad)** – songs which tell a story, and (generally) have very little for other people to join in with.

There are **[comedy songs](/tags/comedy)** (your definition of ‘comedy’ may vary), and songs that are **[parodies of other songs](/tags/parody)**. We’ve also got **[rewritten](/tags/rewritten)** songs – traditional songs that have been given dramatic overhauls. 

For a less human-centric viewpoint, we’ve got songs on **[ocean creatures](/tags/sea_creatures)**, which include **[whales](/tags/whales)**, fish, albatrosses and mermaids. And songs which include **[ghosts and supernatural phenomena](/tags/supernatural/)** in various forms. We’ve also got songs **[about the ships themselves](/tags/ship/)**.

Some of the most joyful songs are about **[coming home](/tags/coming_home)** and **[drinking](/tags/drinking)**. On the sadder end of the spectrum we’ve got songs about **[saying goodbye](/tags/farewell)**, either to the land or to the sea. There are some **[minor-key songs](/tags/minor_key)** and **[laments](/tags/lament)**, alongside uplifting songs about **[hope](/tags/hope)** and **[perseverance in the face of adversity](/tags/perseverance)**.

The songbook contains songs by lots of people – and among our favourite writers and performers are **[Nancy Kerr](/tags/nancy_kerr/)**, **[Janie Meneely](/tags/Janie_Meneely/)**, **[Cicely Fox Smith](/tags/Cicely_Fox_Smith)** and **[Stan Rogers](/tags/Stan_Rogers/)**. We’ve also got a load of lyrics which were **[originally published as poetry](/tags/originally_a_poem/)** and set to music later.

Some tell stories about **[real historic events](/tags/historic_events/)**. And we’ve got songs which **[acknowledge the modern nautical world](/tags/modern_seafaring/)** – that is, those that reflect that we’re (mostly) not travelling about in sailing ships any more.

Songs originate from around the globe, and we’ve got songs tagged with **[France](/tags/France/)**, **[Ireland](/tags/Ireland/)**, **[Scotland](/tags/Scotland/)** and **[Australia](/tags/Australia/)**. These are either ‘from’ that place, or have a link to it. We’ve also got songs about seeking the **[Northwest Passage](/tags/northwest_passage/)**, and songs from or about the **[Northeast of England](/tags/northeast_england/)** and the **[Northwest of England](/tags/northwest_england/)**.

We’ve got shanties that **[are heard in the “Assassin’s Creed” computer game](/tags/assassins_creed/)** (although the Auntie Shanty versions are slightly different). We’ve also got **[songs which appeared in popular films](/tags/appears_in_a_film/)**, songs **[from the Fisherman’s Friends movies](/tags/appears_in_fishermans_friends/)**, and (because it’s an excellent bit of trivia) we’ve got **[sea songs that appear in Russell Crowe films](/tags/appears_in_a_russell_crowe_film/).**

We’ve got songs **[for multiple ‘voices’](/tags/two_voices/)** – these can be led solo, but we think they work best with different people (or groups) singing the different parts. Some of these have **[fancy colours](/tags/technicolour)** in the songbook version.

A few miscellaneous categories – we’ve got songs mentioning **[rivers](/tags/rivers)**, songs **[about shipwrecks](/tags/shipwreck/)** , songs **[written since 2000](/tags/post-2000/)** and **[songs in languages other than English](/tags/non-english-language/)**.

And last-but-not-least, for the Auntie Shanty sessions in which “herring half-hour” happens, we’ve got the perennial favourite “**[songs about herring](/tags/herring/)**”.
