They say, old man, your horse will die

> And they say so, and we hope so

They say, old man, your horse will die

> Oh poor old man

And if he dies then we'll tan his hide

Aye and if he dies then we'll tan his hide

And if he lives then we'll ride again

Aye and if he lives then we'll ride again

He's as dead as a nail in the lamp room floor

He's as dead as a nail in the lamp room floor

Aye and he won't bother us no more

Aye and he won't bother us no more

It's mahogany beef and the weevily bread

It's mahogany beef and the weevily bread

And I thought I heard the old man say

Just one more pull and then belay

Just one more pull and that will do

For we're the lads to kick her through
