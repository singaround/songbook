They say, old man, your horse will die\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
They say, old man, your horse will die\
***Oh poor old man***

And if he dies then we'll tan his hide\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
Aye and if he dies then we'll tan his hide\
***Oh poor old man***

And if he lives then we'll ride again\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
Aye and if he lives then we'll ride again\
***Oh poor old man***

He's as dead as a nail in the lamp room floor\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
He's as dead as a nail in the lamp room floor\
***Oh poor old man***

Aye and he won't bother us no more\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
Aye and he won't bother us no more\
***Oh poor old man***

It's mahogany beef and the weevily bread\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
It's mahogany beef and the weevily bread\
***Oh poor old man***

And I thought I heard the old man say\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
Just one more pull and then belay\
***Oh poor old man***

Just one more pull and that will do\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
For we're the lads to kick her through\
***Oh poor old man***
