They say, old man, your horse will die\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
They say, old man, your horse will die\
***Oh poor old horse***

And if he dies then we'll tan his hide\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
Aye and if he dies then we'll tan his hide\
***Oh poor old horse***

And if he lives then we'll ride again\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
Aye and if he lives then we'll ride again\
***Oh poor old horse***

He's as dead as a nail in the lamp room floor\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
He's as dead as a nail in the lamp room floor\
***Oh poor old horse***

Aye and he won't bother us no more\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
Aye and he won't bother us no more\
***Oh poor old horse***

It's mahogany beef and the weevily bread\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
It's mahogany beef and the weevily bread\
***Oh poor old horse***

Just one more pull and that will do\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
For we're the lads to kick her through\
***Oh poor old horse***

We'll rop him down with a long, long rope\
***And they say so, and we hope so***\
Where the sharks'll have his body and the devil take his soul!\
***O, poor old horse***
