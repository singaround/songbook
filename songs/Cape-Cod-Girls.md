description: >-
  This was likely used as a long haul or halyard shanty. The named town could be substituted for the name of another
  fishing town, should the sailors wish the song's jokes to be at someone else's
  expense.

Cape Cod girls ain't got no combs\
***Haul away, haul away***\
They comb their hair with codfish bones\
***And we're bound away for Australia***

> ***So heave away, my bully, bully boys\
Haul away, haul away\
Heave away, why don't you make some noise\
And we're bound away for Australia***

Cape Cod kids ain't got no sleds\
***Haul away, haul away***\
They slide down the hills on codfish heads\
***And we're bound away for Australia***

> ***So heave away, my bully, bully boys...***

Cape Cod men ain't got no ale\
***Haul away, haul away***\
They fill their glasses with codfish tails\
***And we're bound away for Australia***

> ***So heave away, my bully, bully boys***

Cape Cod folk ain't got no ills\
***Haul away, haul away***\
Cape Cod doctors give 'em codfish pills\
***And we're bound away for Australia***

> ***So heave away, my bully, bully boys\
Haul away, haul away\
Heave away, why don't you make some noise\
And we're bound away for Australia***

Cape Cod mothers don't bake no pies\
***Haul away, haul away***\
They feed their kids on codfish eyes\
***And we're bound away for Australia***

> ***So heave away, my bully, bully boys***

Cape Cod cats ain't got no tails\
***Haul away, haul away***\
They got blown off by the northeast gales
***And we're bound away for Australia***
