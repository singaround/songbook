>***Dance to your Daddy, my little laddie\
Dance to your Daddy, my little man\
Dance to your Daddy, my little laddie\
Dance to your Daddy, my little man.***

You shall have a fishie, you shall have a fin\
You shall have a herring when the boat comes in\
You shall have a codling boiled in a pan\
Dance to your Daddy, my little man

>***Dance to your Daddy, my little laddie\
Dance to your Daddy, my little man\
Dance to your Daddy, my little laddie\
Dance to your Daddy, my little man.***

You shall have a fishie, you shall have a fin\
You shall have a herring when the boat comes in\
You shall have a crayfish for your dinner pan\
Dance to your Daddy, my little man

You shall have a fishie, on a little dishie\
You shall have a bloater when the boat comes in\
You shall have a fishie, on a little dishie\
You shall have a kipper when the boat comes in

>***Dance to your Daddy, sing to your Mummy\
Dance to your Daddy, to your Mummy sing\
Dance to your Daddy, my little laddie\
Dance to your Daddy, to your mummy sing.***
