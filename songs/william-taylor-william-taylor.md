  YJ: I like this tune but not sure how the girl comes across? Is it okay that
  she goes to sea to follow a man, and then gets jealous and shoots him and his
  new girlfriend, and then the bit about her boobs is kinda funky but maybe
  okay......?

William Taylor was a brisk young sailor
Full of heart and full of play
Till his mind he did uncover
To a youthful lady gay
Four and twenty British sailors
Met him on the king's highway
As he went for to be married
Pressed he was and sent away

> ***Folleri-de-dom, de- daerai diddero***
Folleri-de-dom, domme daerai dae
Folleri-de-dom, de- daerai diddero
Folleri-de-dom, domme daerai dae

Sailor's clothing she put on
And went on board a man-o-war
Her pretty little fingers long and slender
They were smeared with pitch and tar
On that ship there was a battle
She amongst the rest did fight
The wind blew off her silver buttons
Her breasts were bared all snowy white

> ***Folleri-de-dom, de- daerai diddero***
Folleri-de-dom, domme daerai dae
Folleri-de-dom, de- daerai diddero
Folleri-de-dom, domme daerai dae

When the captain did discover
He said Fair maid, what brought you here?
Sir, I‘m seeking William Taylor.
Pressed he was by you last year.
If you rise up in the morning.
Early at the break of day.
There you'll find young William Taylor
Walking with his lady gay.

> ***Folleri-de-dom, de- daerai diddero***
Folleri-de-dom, domme daerai dae
Folleri-de-dom, de- daerai diddero
Folleri-de-dom, domme daerai dae

She rose early in the morning
Early at the break of day
There she spied young William Taylor
Walking with his lady gay
She procured a pair of pistols
On the ground where she did stand
There she shot bold William Taylor
And the lady at his right hand
