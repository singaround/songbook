description: >-
  Nancy Kerr generously gave us permission to reproduce lyrics of her original
  sea songs. Fragile Water, from the album Instar, 
  explores gender fluidity, transition and transformation, inspired by Orkney
  folk song 'The Grey Selkie of Sule Skerry'. In folklore, selkies shed their
  seal skin to become human on land.

I am a man upon the land\
Cold and slender as a secret river\
And glamour folds within my hand\
Like a salmon skin of beaten silver

> ***My little fish slip off your skin***\
> ***And leave it in the tide for gulls to plunder***\
> ***And if you wish to walk or swim***\
> ***Let there be nothing in the world to hinder***

I cannot walk among your kin\
For after water, land seems so much harder\
But I will fall from wandering\
To land on beaten sand and fragile water

> ***My little fish slip off your skin\
And leave it in the tide for gulls to plunder\
And if you wish to walk or swim\
Let there be nothing in the world to hinder***

There are other gifts than silver\
Like another word for lover\
If we only hold each other\
We are beaten sand and fragile water

You know the ocean will bleach our bones\
You know the burning sun will melt the boulders\
Don't mourn my shadow among the stones\
For after winter, spring seems somehow colder

But as the ocean courts the strand\
'Til he becomes the grit that surges in her\
So generations may understand\
We are all beaten sand and fragile water

> ***My little fish slip off your skin\
And leave it in the tide for gulls to plunder\
And if you wish to walk or swim\
Let there be nothing in the world to hinder***

If we only hold each other\
We are beaten sand and fragile water

There are other gifts than silver\
Like another word for lover\
If we only hold each other\
We are beaten sand and fragile water\
***We are beaten sand and fragile water***
