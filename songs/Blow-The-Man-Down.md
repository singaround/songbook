description: >-
  The Black Ball Line was the name of two fleets of transatlantic packet ships,
  one based in Liverpool and the other in New York. 'Kicking Jack Williams' was
  a captain on the American side. Infamous for tough discipline on board, he was
  also famed for record-breaking runs.

Come all you young fellows that follow the sea,\
***(To me) way, hey, blow the man down***\
Now please pay attention and listen to me\
***Give me some time to blow the man down***

> ***Blow the man down to me, blow the man down,***\
> ***(To me) way, hey, blow the man down***\
> ***Blow him right back in to Liverpool town,***\
> ***Give me some time to blow the man down***

I'm a deep water sailor just come from Hong Kong,\
***To me way, hey, blow the man down***\
You give me some whiskey I'll sing you a song\
***Give me some time to blow the man down***

> ***Blow the man down to me...***

'Twas on a black baller I first served my time,\
***(To me) way, hey, blow the man down***\
On a trim black ball liner I wasted me prime\
***Give me some time to blow the man down***

> ***Blow the man down to me...***

When a trim black ball liner's preparing for sea,\
***(To me) way, hey, blow the man down***\
You'll split your sides laughing, such sights you would see\
***Give me some time to blow the man down***

> ***Blow the man down to me, blow the man down,***\
> ***(To me) way, hey, blow the man down***\
> ***Blow him right back in to Liverpool town,***\
> ***Give me some time to blow the man down***

Now when the big liner, she's clear of the land,\
***(To me) way, hey, blow the man down***\
Our bosun he roars out the word of command\
***Give me some time to blow the man down***

> ***Blow the man down to me...***

"Come quickly, lay aft to the break of the poop,\
***(To me) way, hey, blow the man down***\
Or I'll help you along with the toe of my boot"\
***Give me some time to blow the man down***

> ***Blow the man down to me...***

Pay attention to orders now, you one and all,\
***To me way, hey, blow the man down***\
For see high above, there flies the Black Ball\
***Give me some time to blow the man down***

> ***Blow the man down to me, blow the man down,***\
> ***(To me) way, hey, blow the man down***\
> ***Blow him right back in to Liverpool town,***\
> ***Give me some time to blow the man down***

'Tis larboard and starboard on deck you will sprawl,\
***(To me) way, hey, blow the man down***\
For Kicking Jack Williams commands the Black Ball\
***Give me some time to blow the man down***

> ***Blow the man down to me...***
