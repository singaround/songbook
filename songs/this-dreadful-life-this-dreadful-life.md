---
When I was just a young man\
I left my family\
Set out upon the ragin’ main,\
To serve Amerikee.

When the fight was over,\
I found I needed more,\
I signed on board a packet ship,\
Bound for some distant shore.

>***I have sailed across the ocean,\
I have rolled upon the sea,\
And this dreadful life I’m livin’\
Is just the life for me.***

It’s haulin line and ropes, me boys,\
And pushin’ capstan ’round;\
Workin’ at the pumps, me boys\
And prayin’ for that sound.

The sound of the bosun callin’,\
To send us all below,\
And end the pain of every day,\
A sailor’s come to know.

>***I have sailed across the ocean...***

When we sailed into Bank Street\
At the old New London port\
Could hear the music playin’\
Saw the dancin’ on the wharf.

The people there were happy\
‘Cause our ship was comin’ in,\
Hoping friends and their relations\
Would not go to sea again.

>***I have sailed across the ocean,\
I have rolled upon the sea,\
And this dreadful life I’m livin’\
Is just the life for me.***

When the mighty ocean tells me\
With a piece of broken deck\
That life on land’s not half as bad,\
As livin’ through a wreck

So I am goin’ home, me boys,\
To the friends I used to know,\
And hoist a jar to everyone\
Who has the urge to go.

>***I have sailed across the ocean,\
I have rolled upon the sea,\
<span style="color:green">And this dreadful life I used to live\
Is not the life for me.</span>***
