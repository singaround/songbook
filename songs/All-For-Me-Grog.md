And it's all for me grog, me jolly, jolly grog\
All for my beer and tobacco\
Well, I spent all my tin\
With the lassies drinking gin\
Far across the Western Ocean I must wander

Where are my boots, my nogging, nogging boots\
All gone for beer and tobacco\
Well the soles they are worn out\
And the heels are kicked about\
And the toes are looking out for better weather

Where is my shirt, my nogging, nogging shirt\
All gone for beer and tobacco\
Well the sleeves they got worn out\
And the collar's turned about\
And the tail is looking out for better weather\
\
Well he's sick In the head and he hasn't been to bed\
Since first he came ashore with his plunder\
He's seen centipedes and snakes\
Till his head is full of aches\
And we hope to take a path to way up yonder
