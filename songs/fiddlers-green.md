As I roved by the dockside one evening so rare,\
To view the still waters and take the salt air\
I heard an old fisherman, singing this song –\
“Oh, take me away, boys, me time is not long”

>***Wrap me up in me oilskins and jumper\
No more on the docks I’ll be seen\
Just tell me old shipmates, I’m taking a trip, mates,\
And I’ll see you someday, in Fiddlers’ Green …***

Now, Fiddlers’ Green is a place, I’ve heard tell,\
Where fishermen go if they don’t go to Hell\
Where the weather is fair, and the dolphins do play\
And the cold coast of Greenland is far, far away

>***Wrap me up in me oilskins and jumper...***

The sky’s always clear, and there’s never a gale\
And the fish jump on board with a flip of their tails\
You can lie at your leisure, there’s no work to do\
And the Skipper’s below, making tea for the crew …

>***Wrap me up in me oilskins and jumper...***

And when you’re in dock, and the long trip is through\
There’s pubs and there’s clubs, and there’s lasses there too\
The girls are all pretty, the beer is all free\
And there’s bottles of rum, growing on every tree …

>***Wrap me up in me oilskins and jumper...***

I don’t want a harp nor a halo, not me\
Just give me a breeze and a good rolling sea\
And I’ll play me old squeezebox as we sail along\
With the wind in the rigging, to sing me this song

>***Wrap me up in me oilskins and jumper...***
