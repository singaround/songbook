They call me hanging Johnny,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
Cos when the weather's sunny\
***I hang, boys, hang!***

I hangs 'em when it's breezy,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
They dries out quick and easy\
***So it's hang, boys, hang!***

I hang out shirts and blouses,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
And pantaloons and trousers\
***So it's hang, boys, hang!***

I hang out stretchy leggings,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
So careful with my peggings\
***So it's hang, boys, hang!***

I even hanged a ballgown,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
Made sure it wouldn't fall down\
***So it's hang, boys, hang!***

I hang my skimpy panties,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
While singing stupid shanties\
***So it's hang, boys, hang!***

The hanging's just beginning,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
we'll have fresh-scented linen\
***So it's hang, boys, hang!***

I hang out my attire\
**Away, boys, away!**\
Ain't got no tumble-dryer\
***So it's hang, boys, hang!***
