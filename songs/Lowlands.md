description: >-
  Here are two versions of lowlands. Version one has a female lover, version two
  a male lover. It should also be noted that in some versions, the last chorus
  line will add an extra few words: Lowlands, sweet lowlands away. If you plan
  to sing this version, just make sure we're clued in before you kick off.

(Version 1)

I dreamed a dream the other night

> _Lowlands, lowlands away my John_

I dreamed a dream the other night

> _Lowlands away_

I dreamed my love came in my sleep\
Her cheeks were wet, her eyes did weep

She came to me at my bedside\
All dressed in white like some fair bride

And bravely in her bosom fair\
A red, red rose, my love did wear

No sound she made, no word she said\
'Twas then I knew my love was dead

Then awoke to hear the cry\
"All hands on deck, oh, watch ahoy!"

(version 2)

I dreamed a dream the other night

> _Lowlands, lowlands away my John_

I dreamed a dream the other night

> _Lowlands away_

I dreamed I saw my own true love\
He stood so still, he did not move

So dank his hair, so dim his eye\
I knew he'd come to say goodbye

"I'm drowned in the lowland sea," he said\
"Oh you and I will ne'er be wed."

"I'll never kiss you more," he said\
"Ne'er kiss you more, for I am dead."

I will cut off my bonny hair\
No other man will find me fair

I dreamed a dream the other night\
I dreamed a dream the other night
