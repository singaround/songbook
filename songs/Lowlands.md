  Here are two versions of lowlands. Version one has a female lover, version two
  a male lover. It should also be noted that in some versions, the last chorus
  line will add an extra few words: Lowlands, sweet lowlands away. If you plan
  to sing this version, just make sure we're clued in before you kick off.

(Version 1)

I dreamed a dream the other night\
***Lowlands, lowlands away my John***\
I dreamed a dream the other night\
***Lowlands away***

I dreamed my love came in my sleep\
***Lowlands, lowlands away my John***\
Her cheeks were wet, her eyes did weep\
***Lowlands away***

She came to me at my bedside\
All dressed in white like some fair bride

And bravely in her bosom fair\
A red, red rose, my love did wear

No sound she made, no word she said\
'Twas then I knew my love was dead

Then awoke to hear the cry\
"All hands on deck, oh, watch ahoy!"

****THIS IS THE END OF THE FIRST VERSION****


(version 2)

I dreamed a dream the other night\
***Lowlands, lowlands away my John***\
I dreamed a dream the other night\
***Lowlands away***

I dreamed I saw my own true love\
***Lowlands, lowlands away my John***\
He stood so still, he did not move\
***Lowlands away***

So dank his hair, so dim his eye\
I knew he'd come to say goodbye

"I'm drowned in the lowland sea," he said\
"Oh you and I will ne'er be wed."

"I'll never kiss you more," he said\
"Ne'er kiss you more, for I am dead."

I will cut off my bonny hair\
No other man will find me fair

I dreamed a dream the other night\
I dreamed a dream the other night
