I dreamed a dream the other night\
***Lowlands, lowlands away my John***\
I dreamed a dream the other night\
***Lowlands away***

I dreamed my love came standing by\
***Lowlands, lowlands away my John***\
Came standing close by my bedside\
***Lowlands away***

"He's drowning in the lowland sea\
***Lowlands, lowlands away my John***\
And never more coming home to me\
***Lowlands away***

He's drowning in the lowlands low
***Lowlands, lowlands away my John***\
And never more shall I him know
***Lowlands away***

He's drowning in the windy lowlands
***Lowlands, lowlands away my John***\
He's drowning in the windy lowlands
***Lowlands away***

I dreamed a dream the other night\
***Lowlands, lowlands away my John***\
I dreamed a dream the other night\
***Lowlands away***
