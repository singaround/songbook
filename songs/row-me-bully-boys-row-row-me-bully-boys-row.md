> ***And it's row me bully boys, we're in a hurry boys,\
We've got a long way to go\
And we'll sing and we'll dance and bid farewell to France\
And it's row me bully boys row***

I'll sing you a song, it's a song of the sea\
***Row me bully boys row***\
I'll sing you a song if you'll sing it with me\
***And it's row me bully boys row***

>***And it's row me bully boys...***

While the first mate is helping the captain aboard\
***Row me bully boys row***\
He looks like a peacock with pistols and sword\
***And it's row me bully boys row***

>***And it's row me bully boys...***

The captain likes whiskey, the mate he likes rum\
***Row me bully boys row***\
We like em both but we can't get us none\
***And it's row me bully boys row***

>***And it's row me bully boys...***

Well come now me lads it is time for to roam\
***Row me bully boys row***\
The old Blue Peter she's calling us home\
***And it's row me bully boys row***

>***And it's row me bully boys...***
