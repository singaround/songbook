In South Australia I was born\
***(To me) heave away, haul away***\
In South Australia round Cape Horn\
***We're bound for South Australia***

> ***Haul away you rolling Kings\
(To me) heave away, haul away\
Haul away, you'll hear me sing\
We're bound for South Australia***

As I walked out one morning fair\
***(To me) heave away, haul away***\
'Twas there I met miss Nancy Blair\
***We're bound for South Australia***

> ***Haul away you rolling Kings...***

She shook me up and I shook her down\
***(To me) heave away, haul away***\
We shook around and round the town\
***We're bound for South Australia***

> ***Haul away you rolling Kings...***

We ran all night and we ran all day\
***(To me) heave away, haul away***\
We ran until I sailed away\
***We're bound for South Australia***

> ***Haul away you rolling Kings\
(To me) heave away, haul away\
Haul away, you'll hear me sing\
We're bound for South Australia***

There ain't but one thing grieves me mind\
***(To me) heave away, haul away***\
To leave Miss Nancy Blair behind\
***We're bound for South Australia***

> ***Haul away you rolling Kings...***

As we wallop 'round Cape Horn\
***(To me) heave away, haul away***\
You'll wish to god you'd never been born\
***We're bound for South Australia***

> ***Haul away you rolling Kings...***

I wish I was on Australia's strand\
***(To me) heave away, haul away***\
With a bottle of whiskey in my hand\
***We're bound for South Australia***
