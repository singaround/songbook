Well, who wouldn't be a sailor lad a-sailing on the main?\
To gain the good will of his captain is to blame.\
For he went ashore one evening for to be\
And that was the beginning of the whole calamity.

>***And it's home, boys, home!\
Home I'd like to be,\
Home for a while in me own country,\
Where the oak and the ash and the bonny rowan tree\
Are all a-blooming freely in the North Country.***

Well I asked her for a handkerchief to tie around me head\
And likewise for a candle for to light me up to bed.\
She tended to me needs just like a young maid ought to do,\
So then I says to her "Why don't you jump in with me too?"

>***And it's home, boys, home!...***

Well she jumped into bed now, taking no alarm,
Thinking a young sailor lad to her could do no harm.
I hugged her, I kissed her the whole night long,
Until she wished the short night had been seven years long.

>***And it's home, boys, home!...***

Well early next morning the sailor lad arose\
And into Mary's apron poured a pocket-full of gold\
Saying "Take this me dear for the mischief I have done,\
For tonight I fear I've left you with a daughter or a son."

>***And it's home, boys, home!...***

Now if it be a girl child, we'll send her out to nurse\
With silver in her pocket and gold in her purse\
And if it be a boy child, we'll give him the jacket blue\
And send him up the rigging like his daddy used to do".

>***And it's home, boys, home!...***

So listen all ye fair maids, take this advice from me,\
Never let a sailor lad an inch above your knee,\
For I trusted one and he beguiled me,\
And left me with a pair of twins to dangle on me knee.

>***And it's home, boys, home!...***
