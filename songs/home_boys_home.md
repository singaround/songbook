Oh who wouldn't be a sailor lad a-sailing on the main\
To gain the good will of his captain is to blame\
For he went ashore one evening for to be\
And that was the beginning of the whole calamity

>***And it's home, boys, home!\
Home I'd like to be\
Home for a while in me own country\
Where the oak and the ash and the bonny rowan tree\
Are all a-blooming freely in the north country***

Now I asked her for a handkerchief to tie around me head\
And likewise for a candle for to light me up to bed\
She tended to me needs just as I like a maid to do\
So then I says to her, “Why don't you jump in with me too?”

>***And it's home, boys, home!...***

Oh she jumped into bed now taking no alarm\
Thinking a young sailor lad to her could do no harm\
I hugged her, I kissed her the whole night long\
Until she wished the short night had been seven years long

>***And it's home, boys, home!...***

Well early next morning the sailor lad arose\
And into Mary's apron poured a pocket full of gold\
Saying,” Take this my dear for the mischief I have done\
For tonight I fear I've left you with a daughter or a son”

>***And it's home, boys, home!\
Home I'd like to be\
Home for a while in me own country\
Where the oak and the ash and the bonny rowan tree\
Are all a-blooming freely in the north country***

Now if it be a girl child we'll send her out to nurse\
With silver in her pocket and gold in her purse\
And if it be a boy child we'll give him the jacket blue,\
And send him up the rigging like his daddy used to do

>***And it's home, boys, home!...***

🔷And if the child’s non-binary then what are we to do?\
Should we send them out to nurse or give them the jacket blue?\
Well to hell with all the stereotypes and fuck the gender roles!\
They’ll never listen anyway, for kids don’t do as they’re told!

>***And it's home, boys, home!...***

🔷Come listen all you fair maids take this advice from me\
Never let a sailor lad an inch above your knee\
For I trusted one and he beguiled me\
But since I’ve got this song as proof he’s paying paternity!

>***And it's home, boys, home!\
Home I'd like to be\
Home for a while in me own country\
Where the oak and the ash and the bonny rowan tree\
Are all a-blooming freely in the north country***
