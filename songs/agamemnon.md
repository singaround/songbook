Where is Henry Adams now that planned the Agamemnon?\
Foundered on the River Plate, in Maldonaldos Bay\
Oak and iron and blood of her, his fine one, his darling\
***Sink him in his hammock, boys, he's gone far away***

>***Oak and iron and blood of her, his fine one, his darling\
Sink him in his hammock, boys, he's gone far away***

Where are all the Beaulieu boys that built the Agamemnon?\
Let them lie 'neath waiting grass, content at where they lay\
Swords and swinging riveters, the sounds will not be waking them\
***Sink them in their hammocks, boys, thеy've gone far away***

>***Swords and swinging rivetеrs, the sounds will not be waking them\
Sink them in their hammocks, boys, they've gone far away***

Where is Captain Nelson now that sailed the Agamemnon?\
Fought and beat the Spanish crews in Cape St. Vincent Bay\
Oak and iron and blood of her, his fine one, his darling\
***Broach the keg of brandy, boys, and send him far away***

>***Oak and iron and blood of her, his fine one, his darling\
Broach the keg of brandy, boys, and send him far away***

Where are all the jolly tars that crewed the Agamemnon?\
Men for whom the carronades were less hard work than play\
Oak and iron and blood were they, and every girl a darling\
***Sink them in their hammocks, lads, they've gone far away***

***Oak and iron and blood were they, and every girl a darling\
Sink them in their hammocks, lads, they've gone far away***

Sing the shanty loud, me boys, we'll rouse the Agamemnon\
Stamp it 'round the capstan and her anchor we will weigh\
Where are all the wooden walls, that cloud of sails a-bearing?\
***They're foundered, sunk, or broken and they've gone far away***

***Where are all the wooden walls, that cloud of sails a-bearing?\
They're foundered, sunk, or broken and they've gone far away***

Where is Henry Adams now that planned the Agamemnon?\
Founded on the River Plate, in Maldonaldo's Bay\
Oak and iron and blood of her, his fine one, his darling\
***Sink him in his hammock, boys, he's gone far away***

***Oak and iron and blood of her, his fine one, his darling\
Sink him in his hammock, boys, he's gone far away***
