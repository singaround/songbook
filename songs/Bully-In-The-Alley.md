description: >-
  The general consensus is that 'bully' means 'drunk' and 'spliced' means
  'married'. We've added some new verses to change the relationship dynamic from
  dilly-dallying, and give Sally more of an active role... which she's used to
  initiate a pre-voyage romp.

> ***So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley***\
> ***Way, hey, bully in the alley***\
> ***So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley***\
> ***Bully down in Shinbone Al***

Sally is the girl that I love dearly\
***Way, hey, bully in the alley***\
Sally is the girl that I spliced nearly\
***Bully down in Shinbone Al***

> ***So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley...***

I went to tell my Sally dear\
***Way, hey, bully in the alley***\
I hoped that she might shed a tear\
***Bully down in Shinbone Al***

> ***So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley...***

Sweet Sally only shook her head\
***Way, hey, bully in the alley***\
She took my hand, took me to bed\
***Bully down in Shinbone Al***

> ***So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley...***

We tossed and tumbled all night long-o\
***Way, hey, bully in the alley***\
In the morning the cock did crow-o\
***Bully down in Shinbone Al***

> ***So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley...***

I left my Sal, went a-sailing\
***Way, hey, bully in the alley***\
Signed on a big ship, went a-whaling\
***Bully down in Shinbone Al***

> ***So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley...***

If ever I get back, she says we'll marry\
***Way, hey, bully in the alley***\
Have six kids and live in Shinbone Alley\
***Bully down in Shinbone Al***

> ***So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley...***
