description: >-
  The general consensus is that 'bully' means 'drunk' and 'spliced' means
  'married'. We've added some new verses to change the relationship dynamic from
  dilly-dallying, and give Sally more of an active role...which she's used to
  initiate a pre-voyage romp.

_So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley_\
_Way, hey, bully in the alley_\
_So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley_\
_Bully down in Shinbone Al_

Sally is the girl that I love dearly\
_Way, hey, bully in the alley_\
Sally is the girl that I spliced nearly\
_Bully down in Shinbone Al_

_So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley_\
_Way, hey, bully in the alley_\
_So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley_\
_Bully down in Shinbone Al_

I went to tell my Sally dear\
I hoped that she might shed a tear\
\
_So help me Bob..._\
\
Sweet Sally only shook her head\
She took my hand, took me to bed\
\
We tossed and tumbled all night long-o\
In the morning the cock did crow-o

I left my Sal, went a-sailing\
Signed on a big ship, went a-whaling

If ever I get back, she says we'll marry\
Have six kids and live in Shinbone Alley
