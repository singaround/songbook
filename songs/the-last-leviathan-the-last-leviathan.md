>***My soul has been torn from me and I am bleeding\
My heart it has been rent and I am crying\
For the beauty around me pales and I am screaming\
I am the last of the great whales and I am dying.***

Last night I heard the cry of my last companion\
The roar of the harpoon gun, then I was alone\
I reflected on days gone by when we were thousands.\
I know why I soon must die the last leviathan.

This morning the sun did rise crimson in the north sky\
The ice was the colour of blood and the winds they did sigh\
I rose to take a breath it was my last one\
From the gun came the roar of death and now I am gone

Now that we're no more, there's no more hunting\
The big feller is now gone there's no use lamenting\
What race is next in line all for the slaughter?\
The elephant or the seal or your sons and daughters?

>***My soul has been torn from me and I am bleeding\
My heart it has been rent and I am crying\
For the beauty around me pales and I am screaming\
I am the last of the great whales and I am dying.***
