It was pleasant and delightful on a midsummer's morn\
And the green fields and the meadows were all covered in corn;\
And the blackbirds and thrushes sang on every green spray\
And the larks they sang melodious at the dawning of the day,\
_And the larks they sang melodious (3x)_ \
_at the dawning of the day._

Now a sailor and his true love were a-walking one day.\
Said the sailor to his true love, “I am bound far away.\
I'm bound for the East Indies where the loud cannons roar\
And I'm bound to leave you Nancy, you're the girl that I adore,\
_And I'm bound to leave you Nancy (3x)_ \
_you're the girl that I adore.”_

Then the ring from off her finger she instantly drew,\
Saying, “Take this, dearest William, and my heart will go too.”\
And as they were embracing tears from her eyes fell,\
Saying, “May I go along with you?” “Oh no, my love, farewell,”\
_Saying, “May I go along with you?” (3x)_ \
_“Oh no, my love, farewell,”_

“Fare thee well my dearest Nancy, no longer can I stay,\
For the topsails are hoisted and the anchors aweigh,\
And the ship she lies waiting for the fast flowing tide,\
And if ever I return again, I will make you my bride,\
_And if ever I return again (3x)_\
_I will make you my bride.”_

It was pleasant and delightful one midsummer's morn\
Those young lovers were united and their baby was born\
And the blackbirds and thrushes sang on every green spray\
And the larks they sang melodious at the dawning of the day,\
_And the larks they sang melodious (3x)_ \
_at the dawning of the day._
