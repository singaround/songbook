description: 'A lovely farewell ballad, with obvious links to ''Adieu, sweet lovely Nancy.'''
---
It was pleasant and delightful on a midsummer's morn\
And the green fields and the meadows were all covered in corn;\
And the blackbirds and thrushes sang on every green spray\
And the larks they sang melodious at the dawning of the day,\
***And the larks they sang melodious (3x)*** \
***at the dawning of the day.***

Now a sailor and his true love were a-walking one day.\
Said the sailor to his true love, “I am bound far away.\
I'm bound for the East Indies where the loud cannons roar\
And I'm bound to leave you Nancy, you're the girl that I adore,\
***And I'm bound to leave you Nancy (3x)*** \
***you're the girl that I adore.”***

Then the ring from off her finger she instantly drew,\
Saying, “Take this, dearest William, and my heart will go too.”\
And as they were embracing tears from her eyes fell,\
Saying, “May I go along with you?” “Oh no, my love, farewell,”\
***Saying, “May I go along with you?” (3x)*** \
***“Oh no, my love, farewell,”***

“Fare thee well my dearest Nancy, no longer can I stay,\
For the topsails are hoisted and the anchors aweigh,\
And the ship she lies waiting for the fast flowing tide,\
And if ever I return again, I will make you my bride,\
***And if ever I return again (3x)***\
***I will make you my bride.”***

Nancy when she saw this says “But he’s the man for me”\
So she’s taken off her long boots and walked into the sea,\
And the starfish they were singing, the underwater orchestra did play,\
And the sharks they played melodeons at the entrance to the bay,\
***And the sharks they played melodeons (3x)***\
***at the entrance to the bay.***

Now Billy when he saw this says “There’s the girl for me”\
So he’s taken off his long boots and jumped into the sea,\
But he hadn’t washed his tootsies for many is the long day,\
And his socks smelled so malodorous that she swam the other way,\
***And his socks smelled so malodorous (3x)***\
***that she swam the other way.***
