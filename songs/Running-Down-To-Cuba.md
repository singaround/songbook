To Cuba's coast we're bound me boys\
***Way, me boys, for Cuba***\
To Cuba's coast boys, don't you make a noise\
***Running down to Cuba.***

> ***Way, me boys, for Cuba\
> Running down to Cuba***

The Captain he will trim the sails\
***Way, me boys, for Cuba***\
Flinging the water out over the rails\
***Running down to Cuba.***

> ***Way, me boys, for Cuba...***

Oh my lord! how the wind do blow\
***Way, me boys, for Cuba***\
Running South from the ice and snow\
***Running down to Cuba.***

> ***Way, me boys, for Cuba...***

Oh, I've got a sister who's nine feet tall\
***Way, me boys, for Cuba***\
She sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall\
***Running down to Cuba.***

> ***Way, me boys, for Cuba...***

Give me a gal who can dance Fandango\
***Way, me boys, for Cuba***\
I'll woo her with melon, papaya and mango\
***Running down to Cuba.***

> ***Way, me boys, for Cuba...***

To Cuba's coast we are bound, away\
***Way, me boys, for Cuba***\
To Cuba's coast at the breaking of the day\
***Running down to Cuba.***

> ***Way, me boys, for Cuba...***
