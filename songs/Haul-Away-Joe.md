description: >-
  We've got rid of the verses criticising the characteristics of various women!
  An ironic singing of verse 3 can be enhanced with another verse in dialogue.
  We've had a stab here with a new verse where our sailor discovers that maybe
  he doesn't want to kiss the girls after all...

Louis was the king of France\
Before the revolut-i-on\
***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***\
But then he got his head chopped off\
Which spoiled his constitut-i-on\
***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***

> ***(To me) way, haul away***\
> ***We'll haul away together***\
> ***(To me) way, haul away***\
> ***We'll haul away Joe***\
> ***(To me) way, haul away***\
> ***We'll haul for better weather***\
> ***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***

Saint Patrick was a gentleman\
He came from decent people\
***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***\
He built a church in Dublin Town\
And on it put a steeple\
***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***

> ***(To me) way, haul away...***

Now when I was a little boy\
And so me mother told me\
***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***\
That if I didn't kiss the girls\
Me lips would all grow mouldy\
***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***

> ***(To me) way, haul away...***
> 
ðŸ”·Well now I only kiss the boys\
ðŸ”·It's them I like to hold me\
ðŸ”·***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***\
ðŸ”·I can't say I miss the girls\
ðŸ”·And me lips did not go mouldy\
ðŸ”·***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe*** \*\*\*

> ***(To me) way, haul away...***
> 
The cook is in the galley boys\
Making duff so handy\
***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***\
The captain's in his cabin lads\
Drinking wine and brandy\
***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***

> ***(To me) way, haul away...***

Way haul away\
We'll haul away the bowline\
***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***\
Way, haul away\
The packet is a-rollin'\
***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***

> ***(To me) way, haul away...***
