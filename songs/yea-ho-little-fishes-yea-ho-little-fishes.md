description: This song was sung by Spencer Tracy in the 1937 film of Rudyard
  Kipling's book "Captains Courageous", which is where many singers first heard
  it. The song is of Portuguese origin which may account for the variety of
  English language versions. This version is adapted from a selection of English
  performances.

There's a song in my heart for the one I love best\
And his portrait is tattooed all over my chest

> **Yea ho, little fishes, don't cry, don't cry,\
Yea ho, little fishes, don't cry, don't cry.**

The ship's under way and the weather is fine,\
And the skipper's down after hanging out extra lines.

> **Yea ho, little fishes, don't cry...**

Little fish when she's caught she fights like a whale,\
And she thrashes the water with her mighty tail.

> **Yea ho, little fishes, don't cry...**

There are fish in the sea and there isn't a doubt,\
Just as fine as the ones that were ever pulled out.

> **Yea ho, little fishes, don't cry...**

The ship's come to harbour and that we'll enjoy,\
And the skipper's down aft hanging out for a buoy.

> **Yea ho, little fishes, don't cry...**

Oh the crew are asleep and the ocean's at rest\
And I'm singing this song to the one I love best.

> **Yea ho, little fishes, don't cry...**
