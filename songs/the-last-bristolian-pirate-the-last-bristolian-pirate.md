I used to be a farmer, and I made a living fine,

I had a little stretch of land along the western line

But times were hard and though I tried, the money wasn't there

And the bankers came and took my land and told me "fair is fair"

I looked for every kind of job, the answer always no

"Hire you now?" they'd always laugh, "we just let twenty go!"

The government, the promised me a measly little sum

But I've got too much pride to end up just another bum.

Then I thought, who gives a damn if all the jobs are gone?

I'm gonna be a PIRATE on the river Severn!



	_And it's a heave! ho! hi! ho! Comin' down the plains_

	_Stealin' wheat and barley and all the other grains_

	_It's a ho! hey! hi! hey! Farmers bar yer doors_

	_When you see the Jolly Roger on the Severn's mighty shores_



Well, you'd think the local farmers would know that I'm at large

But just the other day I found an unprotected barge

I snuck up right behind them and they were none the wiser,

I rammed their ship and sank it and I stole their fertilizer!

A bridge outside of Chepstow spans the mighty river

Farmers cross in so much fear their stomachs are a'quiver

Cause they know that Tractor Jack is hidin' in the bay

I'll jump the bridge and knock them cold and sail off with their hay!



	_And it's a heave! ho! hi! ho! Comin' down the plains_

	_Stealin' wheat and barley and all the other grains_

	_It's a ho! hey! hi! hey! Farmers bar yer doors_

	_When you see the Jolly Roger on the Severn's mighty shores_



Well, PC Bob he chased me, he was always at my throat

He followed on the shoreline cause he didn't own a boat

But cutbacks were a'coming and the Mountie lost his job

So now he's sailing with us, and we call him Salty Bob!

A swingin' sword, a skull and bones and pleasant company

I never pay my income tax and screw the VAT (SCREW IT!!)

Sailin down to Thornbury, the terror of the seas

If you wanna get to Tesco boys, you gotta get by me!



	_And it's a heave! ho! hi! ho! Comin' down the plains_

	_Stealin' wheat and barley and all the other grains_

	_It's a ho! hey! hi! hey! Farmers bar yer doors_

	_When you see the Jolly Roger on the Severn's mighty shores_



Well, Pirate life's appealing but you just don't find it here,

I hear that up in Yorkshire there's a band of buccaneers

They roam around the Yorkshire Dales from Yarm to Brierly

And you're gonna lose your flat cap if you have to pass their way!

Well, winter is a'comin' and a chill is in the breeze

My pirate days are over once the river starts to freeze

I'll be back in springtime but now I have to fly

I hear there's lots of plunderin' down in the Isle of Wight!



	_And it's a heave! ho! hi! ho! Comin' down the plains_

	_Stealin' wheat and barley and all the other grains_

	_It's a ho! hey! hi! hey! Farmers bar yer doors_

	_When you see the Jolly Roger on the Severn's mighty shores_

	_When you see the Jolly Roger on the Severn's mighty shores_
