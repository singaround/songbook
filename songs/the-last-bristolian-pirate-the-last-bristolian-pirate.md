I used to be a farmer, and I made a living fine,\
I had a little stretch of land along the western line\
But times were hard and though I tried, the money wasn't there\
And the bankers came and took my land and told me "fair is fair"

I looked for every kind of job, the answer always no\
"Hire you now?" they'd always laugh, "we just let twenty go!"\
The government, the promised me a measly little sum\
But I've got too much pride to end up just another bum.

Then I thought, who gives a damn if all the jobs are gone?\
I'm gonna be a PIRATE on the river Severn!

***And it's a heave! ho! hi! ho! Comin' down the plains***\
***Stealin' wheat and barley and all the other grains***\
***It's a ho! hey! hi! hey! Farmers bar yer doors***\
***When you see the Jolly Roger on the Severn's mighty shores***

Well, you'd think the local farmers would know that I'm at large\
But just the other day I found an unprotected barge\
I snuck up right behind them and they were none the wiser,\
I rammed their ship and sank it and I stole their fertilizer!

A bridge outside of Chepstow spans the mighty river\
Farmers cross in so much fear their stomachs are a'quiver\
Cause they know that Tractor Jack is hidin' in the bay\
I'll jump the bridge and knock them cold and sail off with their hay!

***And it's a heave! ho! hi! ho! Comin' down the plains***\
***Stealin' wheat and barley and all the other grains***\
***It's a ho! hey! hi! hey! Farmers bar yer doors***\
***When you see the Jolly Roger on the Severn's mighty shores***

Well, PC Bob he chased me, he was always at my throat\
He followed on the shoreline cause he didn't own a boat\
But cutbacks were a'coming and the Mountie lost his job\
So now he's sailing with us, and we call him Salty Bob!\

A swingin' sword, a skull and bones and pleasant company\
I never pay my income tax and screw the VAT (SCREW IT!!)\
Sailin down to Thornbury, the terror of the seas\
If you wanna get to Tesco boys, you gotta get by me!

***And it's a heave! ho! hi! ho! Comin' down the plains***\
***Stealin' wheat and barley and all the other grains***\
***It's a ho! hey! hi! hey! Farmers bar yer doors***\
***When you see the Jolly Roger on the Severn's mighty shores***

Well, Pirate life's appealing but you just don't find it here,\
I hear that up in Yorkshire there's a band of buccaneers\
They roam around the Yorkshire Dales from Yarm to Brierly\
And you're gonna lose your flat cap if you have to pass their way!

Well, winter is a'comin' and a chill is in the breeze\
My pirate days are over once the river starts to freeze\
I'll be back in springtime but now I have to fly\
I hear there's lots of plunderin' down in the Isle of Wight!

***And it's a heave! ho! hi! ho! Comin' down the plains***\
***Stealin' wheat and barley and all the other grains***\
***It's a ho! hey! hi! hey! Farmers bar yer doors***\
***When you see the Jolly Roger on the Severn's mighty shores***
