Oh the hog-eyed sailors roll and go\
When they come down from San Francisco

>***With a hog-eye\
Railroad navvy with his hog-eye\
Oh, you roll ashore with a hog-eye oh\
She wants the hog-eyed man***

So off and hand and primed is he\
He'll spend his money fast and free

>***With a hog-eye...***

Now Susie's at the seaside sifting sand\
With a big old grin for a hog-eyed man

>***With a hog-eye...***

And Sally's in the garden shelling peas\
Her little hog-eye is sitting on her knees

>***With a hog-eye...***

So it's hand me down my walking cane\
For I'm going to see my darling Jane

>***With a hog-eye...***

It's a hog-eye ship and a hog-eye crew\
A hog-eyed mate and skipper too
