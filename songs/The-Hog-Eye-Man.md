Oh the hog-eyed sailors roll and go

When they come down from San Francisco

*With a hog-eye*

> *Railroad navvy with his hog-eye*
>
> *Oh, you roll ashore with a hog-eye oh*
>
> *She wants the hog-eyed man*

So off and hand and primed is he

He'll spend his money fast and free

He'll go ashore where the girls do dwell

He'll hoist them high and he'll ring their bells

Now Susie's at the seaside sifting sand

With a big old grin for a hog-eyed man

And Sally's in the garden shelling peas

Her little hog-eye is sitting on her knees

And Jennie's in the garden making dough

The cheeks of her arse go chuff, chuff, chuff

So it's hand me down my walking cane

For I'm going to see my darling Jane

Now who\'s been here since I\'ve been gone

Some railroad navvy with his sea-boots on

It's a hog-eye ship and a hog-eye crew

A hog-eyed mate and skipper too
