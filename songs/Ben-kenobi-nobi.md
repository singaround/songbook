I heard the R2-D2 say\
***Ben Kenobi, Nobi too lie ay***\
Millenium Falcon's on its way\
***Ben Kenobi, Nobi too lie ay***

> ***Too lie ay, Oh, too lie ay\
Ben Kenobi, Nobi too lie ay***

Who taught Luke about the Force?\
***Ben Kenobi, Nobi too lie ay***\
Who's the Fountain, who's the Source?\
***Ben Kenobi, Nobi too lie ay***

> ***Too lie ay, Oh, too lie ay...***

Who does Alec Guinness play?\
***Ben Kenobi, Nobi too lie ay***\
Who's not in The Darling Buds Of May?\
***Ben Kenobi, Nobi too lie ay***

> ***Too lie ay, Oh, too lie ay...***

Who stands next to Harrison Ford?\
***Ben Kenobi, Nobi too lie ay***\
Carrying a bloody great big sword?\
***Ben Kenobi, Nobi too lie ay***

> ***Too lie ay, Oh, too lie ay...***

What comes after Jedi Day?\
***Ben Kenobi, Nobi too lie ay***\
Jedi Night, so the old men say\
***Ben Kenobi, Nobi too lie ay***

> ***Too lie ay, Oh, too lie ay...***
