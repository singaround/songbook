In eighteen hundred and forty-six\
And of March the eighteenth day,\
We hoisted our colours to the top of the mast\
***And for Greenland sailed away, brave boys,***\
***And for Greenland sailed away.***

The lookout in the crosstrees stood\
With spyglass in his hand;\
There's a whale, there's a whale, and a whalefish he cried\
***And she blows at every span, brave boys***\
***And she blows at every span.***

The captain stood on the quarter deck,\
The ice was in his eye;\
Overhaul, overhaul! let your gibsheets fall,\
***And you'll put your boats to sea, brave boys***\
***And you'll put your boats to sea.***

Our harpoon struck and the line played out,\
With a single flourish of his tail,\
He capsized the boat and we lost five men,\
***And we did not catch the whale, brave boys,***\
***And we did not catch the whale.***

The losing of those five jolly men,\
It grieved the captain sore,\
But the losing of that fine whalefish\
***Now it grieved him ten times more, brave boys***\
***Now it grieved him ten times more.***

Oh Greenland is a barren land\
A land that bears no green\
Where there's ice and snow, and the whalefishes blow\
***And the daylight's seldom seen, brave boys***\
***And the daylight's seldom seen.***
