I saw a ship a-sailing\
A-sailing on the sea\
And, oh the hold was laden\
With pretty things for me!

There were candies in the cabin\
And apples in the hold\
The sails were made of silver\
And the masts were made of gold

The four-and-twenty sailors\
That stood between the decks\
Were four-and-twenty white mice\
With chains about their necks

The captain was a duck\
With a packet on his back\
And when the ship began to sail\
The captain cried, "Quack, quack"
