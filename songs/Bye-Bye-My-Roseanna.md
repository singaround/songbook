The boats are sailing round the bay,\
***Bye-bye my Roseanna.***\
All loaded down with fishermen,\
***I won't be home tomorrow.***

> ***Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye\
Bye-bye, my Roseanna\
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye\
I won't be home tomorrow***

A dollar a day is a fisherman's pay\
***Bye-bye my Roseanna.***\
It's easy come, easy go away\
***I won't be home tomorrow.***

> ***Bye-bye, bye-bye...***

We're leaving port at break of day\
***Bye-bye my Roseanna.***\
We're sailing out across the bay\
***I won't be home tomorrow.***

> ***Bye-bye, bye-bye...***

Around the horn we must go\
***Bye-bye my Roseanna.***\
The gales are strong and the winds do blow\
***I won't be home tomorrow.***

> ***Bye-bye, bye-bye...***

Roseanne, my Roseanne\
***Bye-bye my Roseanna.***\
I'm going away but not to stay\
***I won't be home tomorrow.***

> ***Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye\
Bye-bye, my Roseanna\
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye\
I won't be home tomorrow***
