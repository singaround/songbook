>***Some old salty, how he used to rock me,\
Jelly Roll or Jerry Lee, how he used to rock me***

Salt fare, North Sea,\
Weird stare. Further than the eye can see.\
He had a head like a toy shop, bow legged stance off,\
Must have been the rolling sea.

>***Some old salty, how he used to rock me,\
Jelly Roll or Jerry Lee, how he used to rock me***

Hull Fair waltzers, bopping to Brenda Lee\
River boat jazz cruise, jiving to the Two-Nineteen

>***Some old salty, how he used to rock me,\
Jelly Roll or Jerry Lee, how he used to rock me***

Down there for dancing, come on Mr Chester please\
Play “Delia’s Gone” for one more round, some old salty’s on his feet

>***Some old salty, how he used to rock me,\
Jelly Roll or Jerry Lee, how he used to rock me***

Salt fare, North Sea,\
Weird stare. Further than the eye can see.\
He had a head like a toy shop, bow legged stance off,\
Must have been the rolling sea.

>***Some old salty, how he used to rock me,\
Jelly Roll or Jerry Lee, how he used to rock me\
Down the Abercrombie***
