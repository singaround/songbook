>***Some old salty, how he used to rock me,\
Jelly Roll or Jerry Lee, how he used to rock me***

Salt fare, North Sea,\
Weird stare. Further than the eye can see.\
He had a head like a toy shop, bow legged stance off,\
Must have been the rolling sea.

>***Some old salty, how he used to rock me,\
Jelly Roll or Jerry Lee, how he used to rock me***

Hull Fair waltzers, bopping to Brenda Lee\
River boat jazz cruise, jiving to the Two-Nineteen

>***Some old salty, how he used to rock me,\
Jelly Roll or Jerry Lee, how he used to rock me***

Down there for dancing, come on Mr Chester please\
Play “Delia’s Gone” for one more round, some old salty’s on his feet

Salt fare, North Sea,\
Weird stare. Further than the eye can see.\
He had a head like a toy shop, bow legged stance off,\
Must have been the rolling sea.

>***Some old salty, how he used to rock me,\
Jelly Roll or Jerry Lee, how he used to rock me\
Down the Abercrombie***
