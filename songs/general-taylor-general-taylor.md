  Also known as 'Walk Me Along Johnny' or 'Walk Him Along John', this shanty
  commemorates the American General [Zachary
  Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary_Taylor), who beat the Mexican
  General Santa AÃ±a at the battle of Molina del Rey (Buena Vista) in February
  1847. He later briefly became the 12th President of the United States. Taylor
  has merged in this song with the legendary figure [Alfred Bulltop
  Stormalong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Bulltop_Stormalong), and
  receives the ceremonial funeral traditionally given to Stormy.

General Taylor's dead and gone\
***Walk him along, John, carry him along***\
Oh, General Taylor's dead and gone\
***Carry him to his burying ground***

>***To me way hey, you Stormy***\
***Walk him along, John, carry him along***\
***To me way hey, you Stormy***\
***Carry him to his burying ground***

Oh I wish that I was old Stormy's son\
I'd build him a ship o' ten thousand tons

>***To me way hey, you Stormy...***

I'd load her down with ale and rum\
And every shellback should have some

>***To me way hey, you Stormy...***

Oh we dug his grave with a silver spade\
His shroud of the softest silk were made

>***To me way hey, you Stormy...***

We lowered him down on a golden chain\
At every link we shouted his name

>***To me way hey, you Stormy***\
***Walk him along, John, carry him along***\
***To me way hey, you Stormy***\
***Carry him to his burying ground***

Oh, General Taylor fought in the fray\
And General Taylor gained the day

>***To me way hey, you Stormy...***
