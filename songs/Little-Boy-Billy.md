There were three men of Bristol City,\
***There were three men of Bristol City***

They stole a ship and went to sea,\
***They stole a ship and went to sea***

There was Gorging Jack and Guzzling Jimmy,\
***There was Gorging Jack and Guzzling Jimmy***

And also Little Boy Billee\
***And also Little Boy Billee***

They stole a tin of captain’s biscuits\
***They stole a tin...*** [etc]

And one large bottle of whiskey

But when they reached the broad Atlantic

They had nothing left but one split pea.

Said Gorging Jack to Guzzling Jimmy,

“We’ve naught to eat – let’s eat Billee.”

“O Little Boy Billee, we’re going to kill and eat yur.

“So undo the top button of your chemie.”

“O may I say my cataclysm,

“That my dear mother taught to me?”

But when he reached the Eleventh Commandment,

He cried “Yo Ho for land I see!”

“I see Jerusalem and Madagascar,

“And North and South Amerikee”

“I see the British fleet at anchor,

“And our Lord Nelson, K.C.B.”

They hung Gorging Jack and Guzzling Jimmy,

But they made an admiral of Little Boy Billee.
