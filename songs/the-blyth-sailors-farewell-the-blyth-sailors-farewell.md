Farewell my dear comrades, a pleasant adieu\
From bonnie Blyth Harbour leaving friends old and new\
To parents and wives and sweethearts a-dear\
Let us join in one chorus with hearty good cheer

> ***Then trusting our vessel to captain and mate***\
> ***For health and for fortune we're subject to fate***\
> ***But we'll dare even death on the wide-ranging main***\
> ***And return to Blyth Harbour again and again***

They'll leave home contented quite Blyth-some and gay\
Fighting the ocean so far far away\
Seeking for cargo in many a strange shore\
Then turn her around for Blyth Harbour once more

> ***Then trusting our vessel to captain and mate***

We're loaded with coal to Holland we're bound\
Then away on down channel where trade can be found\
Calling ports there from France through to Spain\
With a westerly breeze turning homeward again

> ***Then trusting our vessel to captain and mate***

Then heave her home boys we are now homeward bound\
With a valuable cargo no matter where found\
With fair wind and weather we'll soon be ashore\
Safe-anchored in bonnie Blyth Harbour once more

> ***Then trusting our vessel to captain and mate***
