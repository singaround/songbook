Oh, it was a fine and a pleasant day,\
Out of Yarmouth harbour I was faring\
As a cabin boy on a sailing lugger,\
***For to go and hunt the shoals of herring.***

Oh, the work was hard and the hours were long\
And the treatment, sure it took some bearing\
There was little kindness and the kicks were many\
***As we hunted for the shoals of herring.***

Oh, we fished the Swarte and the Broken Bank;\
I was cook and I’d a quarter-sharing.\
And I used to sleep standing on my feet\
***And I’d dream about the shoals of herring.***

Well, we left the homegrounds in the month of June,\
And to canny Shields we soon was bearing,\
With a hundred cran of the silver darlings\
***That we’d taken from the shoals of herring.***

Now you’re up on deck, you’re a fisher too.\
You can swear and show a manly bearing.\
Take your turn on watch with the other fellows\
***While you’re following the shoals of herring.***

In the stormy seas and the living gales\
Just to earn your daily bread you’re daring\
From the Dover Straits to the Faeroe Islands\
***While you’re following the shoals of herring.***

Well, I earned my keep and I paid my way,\
And I earned the gear that I was wearing,\
Sailed a million miles, caught ten million fishes,\
***We was following the shoals of herring.***
