Did you ever see the wild goose sailing on the ocean\
***Ranzo my boys, oh Ranzo Ray***\
They're just like them pretty girls when they get the notion\
***Ranzo my boys, oh Ranzo Ray***

>***Ranzo, you'll rue the day\
As the wild goose sails away\
Ranzo, you'll rue the day\
As the wild goose sails away***

As I was walking one evening by the river\
***Ranzo my boys, oh Ranzo Ray***\
I met with a pretty girl my heart it was a quiver\
***Ranzo my boys, oh Ranzo Ray***

>***Ranzo, you'll rue the day...***

I said how are you doing this morning\
***Ranzo my boys, oh Ranzo Ray***\
She said none the better for the seeing of you\
***Ranzo my boys, oh Ranzo Ray***

>***Ranzo, you'll rue the day...***

You broke my heart oh you broke it full sore\
***Ranzo, my boys, oh Ranzo Ray***\
If I sail like the wild goose, you'll break it no more\
***Ranzo, my boys, oh Ranzo Ray***

>***Ranzo, you'll rue the day...***
