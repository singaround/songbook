Once there was a barge lad\
***Way up atop the mast***\
Shouting to the skipper "we've made it home at last"\
Well I was that barge lad\
***Way up atop the mast***\
But now I'm the skipper and that young nipper had better be holding fast

> ***Oh, we're loaded down with bales so high***\
> ***You've got to lean backwards if you want to see the sky***\
> ***Oh, the Thames may forgive us, but the old never will***\
> ***So eyes front and away we sail***

Oh, you've got to be able\
***Way up atop the mast***\
Your legs better be nimble and your head better think fast\
Well I was that able\
***Way up atop the mast***\
But now I'm the skipper and that young nipper is hardy enough to last

> ***Oh, we're loaded down with bales so high***\
> ***You've got to lean backwards if you want to see the sky***\
> ***Oh, the Thames may forgive us, but the old never will***\
> ***So eyes front, keep your head, and away we sail***

Oh, you've eyes like an eagle\
***Way up atop the mast***\
Spotting all the obstacles that come across your path\
Well, I was that eagle\
***Way up atop the mast***\
But now I'm the skipper and that young nipper will keep us from taking a bath

> ***Oh, we're loaded down with bales so high***\
> ***You've got to lean backwards if you want to see the sky***\
> ***Oh, the Thames may forgive us, but the old never will***\
> ***So eyes front, keep your head, clear your throat, and away we sail***

Oh, you've got to remember\
***Way up atop the mast***\
Knowing all the river routes that you never learn from the charts\
Well, I do remember\
***Way up atop the mast***\
But now I'm the skipper and that young nipper is taking the rivers to heart

> ***Oh, we're loaded down with bales so high***\
> ***You've got to lean backwards if you want to see the sky***\
> ***Oh, the Thames may forgive us, but the old never will***\
> ***So eyes front, keep your head, clear your throat,***\
> ***Know your way, fill your pipe,***\
> ***Grab on tight, look for the light and away we sail***
