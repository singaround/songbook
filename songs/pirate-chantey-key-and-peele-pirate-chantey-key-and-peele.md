I once met a lass so fine,\
She was drunk on barley wine\
I'd been to sea for months of three\
I knew I could make her mine\
And the lass was past consent\
So it was off with her we went\
And we threw her in bed and rested her head\
And we left, 'cause that's what gentlemen do.

***A woman has a right to a drink or two***\
***Without worrying about what you will do***\
***We say "yo, ho!" but we don't say "ho"***\
***'Cause "ho" is disrespectful, yo***

There once was a girl from Leeds\
Who I heard was good on her knees\
So I docked my ship for an overnight trip\
To take care of all of my needs\
She had piles of tales to tell\
And my mast began to swell\
So I laid her down and raised her gown\
And performed cunnilingus for an hour or so

***Always take care of your lady fair***\
***'Cause they deserve as much attention down there***\
***We say "yo, ho!" but we don't say "ho"***\
***'Cause "ho" is disrespectful, yo***

I once had a woman so fair\
Whose womb contained my heir\
With a son by my side, the seas we'd ride\
The child she would bear\
But my girl, she was no fool\
She was working her way through school\
So I did support when she chose to abort\
Because it's her body and therefore her choice

***A woman has a right to a drink or two***\
***Without worrying about what you will do***\
***We say "yo, ho!" but we don't say "ho"***\
***'Cause "ho" is disrespectful, yo***

No, we don't say "booty" 'less we're talking 'bout gold\
We don't look at chests 'less it treasure holds\
With a hat and a feather and a cutlass on her hip\
We will never say "she" when we're talking 'bout a ship\
We don't say "bitch" and we don't say "whore"\
'Cause that language leads to things like body dysmorphia

There was a lady with a golden eye\
And the doctor said she would die\
So she emptied her purse to lift the curse\
And prayed to stay alive\
She awoke the very next day\
Hand in her grave she lay\
But the scariest part of the story from the start\
Is I bet you assume the doctor was a man

***Women are doctors too***\
***And for a fraction of the dubloons***\
***We say "yo, ho!" but we don't say "ho"***\
***'Cause "ho" is disrespectful, yo***
