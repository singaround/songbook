  A sentimental song sung by a mother to her sailor son. The words are based on
  a poem published in [_La Belle Assemblée, or Bell's Court and Fashionable
  Magazine Addressed Particularly to the
  Ladies_](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NXEAAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA163&dq=la%20belle%20assemblee%20sailor&pg=PA163#v=onepage&q=la%20belle%20assemblee%20sailor&f=false)_,_
  in 1807. The tune is pretty close to The Blackest Crow.

In midnight sleep, the sailor boy lay\
His hammock swang loose in the wind\
But watch-worn weary, his cares slipped away\
And sweet dreams rose into his mind

>***My sailor boy, I wish you sweet sleep\
As you’re rocked by the waves so deep\
My sailor boy come safely home\
Come safely home to me***

He dreamt of his childhood home far away\
His parents’ fond smiles of delight\
The sweetheart who’s waiting for him some day\
Her green eyes shining bright

The sleeper’s heart beats fast in his chest\
As the stars light heaven’s dome \
And a murmur of longing steals through his rest\
‘Oh God, lead me home to them, please send me home.’

But what’s this flame that blinds his eye?\
And what is this thunder that deafens his ear?\
Is it lightning painting bright hell on the sky?\
Or the roar of the cannon that all sailors fear?

>***My sailor boy, I wish you sweet sleep\
As you’re rocked by the waves so deep\
My sailor boy come safely home\
Come safely home to me***

He leaps from his hammock, he flies to the deck\
Bells toll as he hears the watch crier\
Wild winds and great waves drive the vessel a wreck\
The masts fly in splinters, the shrouds are on fire

Oh sailor boy, doomed there to stay\
Unblessed, drowned deep in the main\
Full many a score fathom your flesh shall decay \
Unmarked by a stone or bright candle flame

Sea foam will be your winding sheet\
And seabirds’ cries soothe your long sleep\
On sea grass rest your weary feet\
And round your white bones red coral will creep
