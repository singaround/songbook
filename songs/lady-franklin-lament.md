It was homeward bound one night on the deep,\
Swinging in my hammock I fell asleep.\
I dreamed a dream and I thought it true\
Concerning Franklin and his gallant crew.

With one hundred seamen he sailed away\
To the frozen ocean in the month of May,\
To seek that passage around the Pole\
Where we poor seamen do sometimes go.

>***In Baffin Bay where the whalefishes blow\
The fate of Franklin no man may know.\
Oh the fate of Franklin no tongue can tell,\
Lord Franklin along with his sailors do dwell.***

Through cruel hardships they vainly strove,\
Their ship on mountains of ice was drove,\
Only the Eskimo in his skin canoe\
Was the only one who ever came through.

>***In Baffin Bay...***

And now my burden it gives me pain,\
For me long lost Franklin Iâ€™d cross the main.\
Oh ten thousand pounds I would freely give\
To say on earth that my Franklin do live.

>***In Baffin Bay...***
