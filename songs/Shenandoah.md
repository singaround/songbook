Oh Shenandoah, I long to see you,\
***Away you rolling river.***\
Oh Shenandoah, I long to see you\
***Away, I'm bound away***\
***Across The wide Missouri.***

Oh Shenandoah, I love your Daughter,\
***Away you rolling river.***\
For her I'd cross your roaming waters,\
***Away, I'm bound away***\
***Across The wide Missouri.***

'Tis seven years since last I've seen you,\
***Away you rolling river.***\
'Tis seven years since last I've seen you,\
***Away, I'm bound away***\
***Across The wide Missouri.***

Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you,\
Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you,

Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you,\
Oh Shenandoah, just to be near you,
