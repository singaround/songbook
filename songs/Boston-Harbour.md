From Boston harbour we set sail

When it was blowing a devil of a gale

With a ring-tail set all avast the mizzen peak

And the Rule Britannia ploughing up the deep

*With a big bow wow, tow row row*

*Fol dee rol dee rye doh day.*

Then up comes the skipper from down below

It\'s look aloft, and it\'s look alow

And it\'s look alow and look aloft

And it\'s \"coil up your ropes, boys, fore and aft\".

Then down to his cabin he quickly crawls

And to his poor old steward bawls

\"Fix me a drink that will make me cough

For it\'s better weather here than it is on top.\"

Now we poor sailors are a-standing on the deck

Blasted rain all a-falling down our neck

Not a drop of grog could he to us afford

But he damns our eyes at every other word.

Now there\'s one thing that we have to crave

That the captain meets with a watery grave

We\'ll throw him down into some dark hole

Where the sharks\'ll have his body and the Devil have his soul.
