From Boston harbour we set sail\
When it was blowing a devil of a gale\
With a ring-tail set all avast the mizzen peak\
And the Rule Britannia ploughing up the deep

_With a big bow wow, tow row row_\
_Fol dee rol dee rye doh day._

Then up comes the skipper from down below\
It's look aloft, and it's look alow\
And it's look alow and look aloft\
And it's "coil up your ropes, boys, fore and aft".

_With a big bow wow, tow row row_\
_Fol dee rol dee rye doh day._

Then down to his cabin he quickly crawls\
And to his poor old steward bawls\
"Fix me a drink that will make me cough\
For it's better weather here than it is on top."

Now we poor sailors are a-standing on the deck\
Blasted rain all a-falling down our neck\
Not a drop of grog could he to us afford\
But he damns our eyes at every other word.

Now there's one thing that we have to crave\
That the captain meets with a watery grave\
We'll throw him down into some dark hole\
Where the sharks'll have his body and the Devil have his soul.
