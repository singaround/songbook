What mired Jonah’s creature\
To see her rise no more?\
What fate conspired to breach her\
One hundred miles from shore?\
For our children stand in silence\
And view her bones in awe\
This heart unreal, these ribs of steel\
Shall sleep and rise no more

>***Rise no more, oh rise no more\
We shall not meet my friend on Canaan’s shore\
Where heav’nly arcs our souls restore\
So sleep and rise no more***

Like a drunken man still drowning\
Work’s thirst long gone before\
The veins within her pounding\
Not blood but molten ore\
For she drew no dragon’s bonus\
To burn all England’s poor\
All those who bleed this earth for greed\
Go sleep and rise no more

>***Rise no more...***

The legend of her shining\
Dark carols only sing\
Of casting ore and grinding\
The echoes only ring\
Bright tears upon us raining\
From steelos gone before\
For all that streamed is nought but dream\
So sleep and rise no more

>***Rise no more, oh rise no more\
We shall not meet my friend on Canaan’s shore\
Where heav’nly arcs our souls restore\
So sleep and rise no more***
