  Nancy Kerr's lyrics draw loosely on the account of the 1593 meeting of Irish
  pirate queen Grace O'Malley/Gráinne Ní Mháille and Queen Elizabeth I. Grace is
  believed to have carried herself in that meeting with the dignity of a queen
  meeting an equal, refusing to bow or accept the title of countess.

  The song was written in 2014 as part of [The Elizabethan
  Session](https://www.folkbytheoak.com/the-elizabethan-session/), commissioned by
  Folk by the Oak and the English Folk Dance and Song Society. Nancy has kindly
  given us permission to reproduce the lyrics here.

  One of our regulars has contributed a third verse using two couplets from
  the poems of Cicely Fox Smith.

Keep your land you gentry of England, France and Spain\
For there’s nothing like dominion of the water\
From the rocky coast of Kerry to the bloody Spanish Main\
It’s the best thing you can ever teach your daughter

> ***Broadside to broadside, two captains collide***\
> ***Queen of the spheres and queen of the tide***\
> ***Regalia and rebellion go sailing side by side***\
> ***Haul away, sister, haul away***

Plunder men for treasure, and never heed their blows\
For there’s nothing given freely to a woman\
Be generous to friendship and lavish to your foes\
Then pirate queens may share the seas in common

> ***Broadside to broadside, two captains collide...***

Blades are bared for battle, these queens of half the world\
And cannons primed and ready with their thunder\
They know just what they fight for when the flag o’ war’s unfurled\
It’s freedom they’ll be seizing with their plunder

> ***Broadside to broadside, two captains collide...***

For blows will make you weary and marriage make a slave\
You’d be better on the sea like brave O’Malley\
And when that gallant vessel goes a rolling on the wave\
Be sure you’re on the deck not in the galley

> ***Broadside to broadside, two captains collide***\
> ***Queen of the spheres and queen of the tide***\
> ***Regalia and rebellion go sailing side by side***\
> ***Haul away, sister,***\
> ***Haul away, sister,***\
> ***Haul away, sister, haul away***
