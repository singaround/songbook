  There are various versions of this song, with slightly different narratives.
  This one features a girl who defies her father's disapproval by secretly
  buying a ship from him, sailing away with her lover, and winning a sea battle
  to start a new life together in Boston.

As I was a-walking one morning in June\
A-viewing wild flowers, all Nature in bloom\
I spied a young couple on Erin's green shore\
They were viewing the ocean where the wild billows roar

He said "Dearest Polly you're the girl I adore\
To be parted from you oh it grieves my heart sore\
Your parents are rich love and angry with me\
And if I tarry with you, I ruined will be"

So she's dressed herself up in a suit of men's clothes\
And to her old father immediately goes\
She's purchased a ship and laid down the demand\
It was little he knew t'was his own daughter's hand

She went to her true love and this she did say\
"Rise up lovely Johnny, there's no time to stay"\
They've hoisted their topsails and hurrahed with joy\
And away o'er the ocean sailed the Lady Leroy

When her father found out how he cursed and did swear\
He sent for his captain and bid him prepare\
For to seek them and find them and their lives destroy\
For they ne'er should enjoy his proud Lady Leroy

The captain was pleased with his orders to go\
For to seek them and find them like some wandering foe\
He spied a fair vessel with her colours let fly\
He hailed her and found she was the Lady Leroy

He's bade them return to old Ireland once more\
Or broadside and broadside upon them would pour\
These brave Irish heroes have made this reply\
"We will never surrender, We'll conquer or die"

So it's broadside and broadside each other did pour\
And louder and louder the cannons did roar\
These brave Irish heroes have gained victory\
Hurrah for true lovers - may they always run free

They've landed in Boston that city of fame\
Of the other ship's commander I'll mention no name\
Here's a health to young Polly, long may she enjoy\
Her bravest of heroes and her Lady Leroy.
