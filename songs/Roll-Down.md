Sweet ladies of Plymouth, we're saying goodbye\
***Ro-o-o-oll down!***\
But we'll rock you and roll you again bye and bye\
***Walk her round, me brave boys and roll down!***

>***And we will ro-o-o-oll down!***\
>***Walk her round, me brave boys and roll down!***

Now the anchor's aweigh and the sails are unfurled\
***Ro-o-o-oll down!***\
And we're bound for to take her half-way round the world\
***Walk her round, me brave boys and roll down!***

>***And we will ro-o-o-oll down!...***

In the wide Bay of Biscay the seas will run high\
***Ro-o-o-oll down!***\
And the poor sickly transports they'll wish they could die\
***Walk her round, me brave boys and roll down!***

>***And we will ro-o-o-oll down!...***

When the wild coast of Africa it do appear\
***Ro-o-o-oll down!***\
The poor nervous transports they'll tremble with fear\
***Walk her round, me brave boys and roll down!***

>***And we will ro-o-o-oll down!...***

When the Cape of Good Hope it is rounded at last\
***Ro-o-o-oll down!***\
The poor lonesome transports they'll long for the past\
***Walk her round, me brave boys and roll down!***

>***And we will ro-o-o-oll down!...***

When the great southern whales on our quarter do spout\
***Ro-o-o-oll down!***\
The poor simple transports they'll goggle and shout\
***Walk her round, me brave boys and roll down!***

>***And we will ro-o-o-oll down!...***

And when we arrive off Australia's strand\
***Ro-o-o-oll down!***\
The poor weary transports they'll long for the land\
***Walk her round, me brave boys and roll down!***

>***And we will ro-o-o-oll down!...***

And when we set sail for old England's shore\
***Ro-o-o-oll down!***\
The poor stranded transports we'll see them no more\
***Walk her round, me brave boys and roll down!***

>***And we will ro-o-o-oll down!...***

Then sweet ladies of Plymouth we'll pay all your rent\
***Ro-o-o-oll down!***\
And go roving no more till our money's all spent\
***Walk her round, me brave boys and roll down!***

>***And we will ro-o-o-oll down!...***
