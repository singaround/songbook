  Nothing wrong with the original but it seems sad that Molly suddenly dies, so
  here's a happier version with some puerile innuendo.

In Dublin's fair city
where the girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow, through streets broad and narrow,
Crying cockles and mussels alive alive-o

> ***Alive alive-o, alive alive-o***\
> ***Crying cockles and mussels alive alive-o***

She was a fishmonger
And sure t'was no wonder
For so were her father and mother before
And they both wheeled their barrows, through streets broad and narrow,
Crying cockles and mussels alive alive-o

> ***Alive alive-o, alive alive-o***\
> ***Crying cockles and mussels alive alive-o***

ðŸ”·A flower girl named Nancy
Soon caught Molly's fancy
And she wooed her with whelks and with muscles so strong
As they both wheeled their barrows through streets broad and narrow
They were teasing and laughing through all the night long

> ***Through all the night long, through all the night long***\
> ***They were teasing and laughing through all the night long***

ðŸ”·Love blossomed between them
I wish you had seen them
Selling blooms from the meadows and fish from the seas
As they both wheeled their barrows through streets broad and narrow
Roses twined in their hair and their joy plain to see

> ***Their joy plain to see, their joy plain to see***\
> ***Roses twined in their hair and their joy plain to see***

ðŸ”·The finest bouquets
Were the ones Nancy made
And the freshest of cockles came from Molly's stall
So while they were courting they both made their fortune
And soon said 'we don't need no cockles no more.â€™

> ***No cockles no more, No cockles no more,***\
> ***And soon said 'we don't need no cockles no more.â€™***
