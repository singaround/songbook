And now my lads be of good cheer\
For the Irish Coast will soon draw near\
And we'll set a course for The Old Cape Clear\
Jenny get your Oatcakes done

***Whip Jamboree, whip Jamboree\
Oh you pig-tailed sailor hanging down behind\
Whip Jamboree, Whip Jamboree\
Oh Jenny get your Oatcakes done***

And now Cape Clear it is in sight\
We'll be off Holyhead by tomorrow night\
And we'll steer a course for The Old Rock Light\
Jenny get your Oatcakes done

***Whip Jamboree, whip Jamboree...***

And now m'lads we're off Holyhead\
No more salt beef or weevily bread\
One man in the chains for to heave the Lead\
Jenny get your Oatcakes done

***Whip Jamboree, whip Jamboree\
Oh you pig-tailed sailor hanging down behind\
Whip Jamboree, Whip Jamboree\
Oh Jenny get your Oatcakes done***

And now we're rounding Fort Perch Rock\
All hammocks lashed and sea-chests locked\
We'll haul her into Waterloo Dock\
Jenny get your Oatcakes done

***Whip Jamboree, whip Jamboree...***

And now my lads we're all in dock\
We'll be off to Dan Lowry's on The Spot\
And there we'll sup from a **Big Pint Pot**\
Jenny get your Oatcakes done
