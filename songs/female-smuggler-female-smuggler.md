description: >-
  Many copies of this popular broadside
  ballad survive. The ending, with the smuggler dressing as a bride to encourage a
  marriage that saves her life, recalls the (somewhat garbled and unreliable)
  story that pirates Mary Read and/or Anne Bonny were saved from hanging by
  pregnancy.

Come listen awhile and you soon shall hear\
By the rolling sea lived a maiden fair\
Her father was of the smuggling trade\
***Like a war-like hero, like a war-like hero, she never was afraid***

Now, in sailor's clothing swell Jane did go,\
Dressed like a sailor from top to toe;\
Her aged father was the only care\
***Of this female smuggler, of this female smuggler, who never did despair.***

With her pistols loaded she went aboard.\
And by her side hung a glittering sword,\
In her belt two daggers; well armed for war\
***Was this female smuggler, was this female smuggler, who never feared a scar.***

Now they had not sail-ed far from the land,\
When a strange sail brought them to a stand.\
"These are sea robbers," this maid did cry,\
***"But the female smuggler, but the female smuggler, will conquer or will die."***

Alongside, then, this strange vessel came.\
"Cheer up " cried Jane," we will board the same;\
We'll run all chances to rise or fall,"\
***Cried this female smuggler, cried this female smuggler, who never feared a ball.***

Now they killed those pirates and took their store,\
And soon returned to Old England's shore.\
With a keg of brandy she walked along,\
***Did this female smuggler, did this female smuggler, who sweetly sang a song.***

Now they were followed by the blockade,\
Who in irons strong did put this young maid.\
But when they brought her to be tried,\
***This young female smuggler, this young female smuggler, stood dressed like a bride.***

Their commodore against her appeared,\
And for her life she greatly feared.\
When he did find to his great surprise\
***'Twas a female smuggler, 'twas a female smuggler, had fought him in disguise.***

He to the judge and jury said,\
"l cannot prosecute this maid,\
Pardon for her on my knees I crave,\
***For this female smuggler, for this female smuggler, so valiant and so brave."***

Then this commodore to her father went,\
To gain her hand he asked his consent.\
His consent and hers he got, so the commodore\
***And the female smuggler, and the female smuggler, are one for evermore.***
