We are three jolly fishermen,\
***We are three jolly fishermen,\
We are three jolly fishermen,\
While the merry, merry bells do ring.***

> Make haste, make haste, you'll be too late,\
***One fish, my dear, I cannot wait,\
For me fine fry of herring\
My bonny silver herring,\
Mind how you sell them\
While the merry, merry bells do ring.***

We cast our nets unto the rocks\
***We cast our nets unto the rocks\
We cast our nets unto the rocks\
While the merry, merry bells do ring.***

> Make haste, make haste, you'll be too late...

We’ve white an’ speckled bellied uns\
***We’ve white an’ speckled bellied uns\
We’ve white an’ speckled bellied uns\
While the merry, merry bells do ring.***

> Make haste, make haste, you'll be too late,\
***One fish, my dear, I cannot wait,\
For me fine fry of herring\
My bonny silver herring,\
Mind how you sell them\
While the merry, merry bells do ring.***

We sell them three for fourpence\
***We sell them three for fourpence\
We sell them three for fourpence\
While the merry, merry bells do ring.***

> Make haste, make haste, you'll be too late...
