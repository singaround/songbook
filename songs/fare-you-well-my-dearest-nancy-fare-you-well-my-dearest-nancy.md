*Henry:*\
Fare you well, my dearest Nancy, for now I must leave you,\
All across the salt seas I am bound for to go,\
But let my long absence be no trouble to you\
For I shall return in the spring, as you know.

*Nancy:*\
Like some pretty sea boy I will dress and go with you,\
In the deepest of danger I shall stand your friend,\
In the cold stormy weather, when the winds they are a blowing,\
My dear, I will be willing to wait upon you then.

*Henry:*\
O your slender little hands they couldn’t handle our tackle,\
And your dainty little feet to our top mast can’t go,\
And the cold stormy weather, you ne'er can endure it,\
So make yourself contented love, be kind and stay on shore.

*Nancy:*\
Then farewell, my dearest Henry, for I must now leave you,\
Unto the salt oceans I too wish to go,\
And let my long absence be no trouble to you,\
For I shall return in the springtime also.
