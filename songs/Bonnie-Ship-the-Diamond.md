description: >-
  By the 1820s the relativity milder northern waters were fished clean, and
  whalemen had to search in more distant corners of the Arctic, including
  Melville Bay in Northwest Greenland. In 1830, fifty British whaleships reached
  the grounds in early June, a month earlier than expected. The winds crowded
  the bay with ice floes and locked most of the fleet in, including the Diamond,
  the Resolution, the Rattler of Leigh (not Battler of Montrose), and the Eliza
  Swan. Twenty ships were crushed and many whalermen froze or drowned. The Eliza
  Swan was among those that got free and brought the sad news home.

The Diamond is a ship, my lads\
For the Davis Strait we're bound\
The quay it is all garnished\
With bonnie friends all round

Captain Thompson gives the order\
To sail the ocean wide\
Where the sun it never sets, my lads\
Nor darkness dims the sky

> ***For it's cheer up my lads\
Let your hearts never fail\
For the bonnie ship the Diamond\
Goes a-hunting for the whale***

Along the quay at Peterhead\
The lasses stand around\
Wi' their shawls all pulled around them\
And the salt tears runnin' down

Don't you weep, my bonnie wee lass\
Though you be left behind\
For the rose will grow on Greenland's ice\
Before we change our mind

> ***For it's cheer up my lads...***

Here's a health to the Resolution\
Likewise the Eliza Swan\
Three cheers for the Battler of Montrose\
And the Diamond, ship of fame

We wear the trousers of the white\
The jackets of the blue\
When we get back to Peterhead\
We'll have full pockets too

> ***For it's cheer up my lads\
Let your hearts never fail\
For the bonnie ship the Diamond\
Goes a-hunting for the whale***

> ***For it's cheer up my lads...***
