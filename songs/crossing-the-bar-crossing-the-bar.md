Sunset and evening star,\
And one clear call for me!\
And may there be no moaning of the bar\
When I put out to sea.

> ***When I put out to sea,***\
> ***When I put out to sea.***\
> ***And may there be no moaning of the bar***\
> ***When I put out to sea.***

But such a tide as moving seems asleep,\
Too full for sound and foam,\
When that which drew from out the boundless deep\
Turns again home.

> ***Turns again home,***\
> ***Turns again home,***\
> ***When that which drew from out the boundless deep***\
> ***Turns again home***

Twilight and evening bell,\
And after that the dark!\
And may there be no sadness of farewell\
When I embark.

> ***When I embark,***\
> ***When I embark,***\
> ***And may there be no sadness of farewell***\
> ***When I embark***

For though from out our bourne of time and place\
The flood may bear me far,\
I hope to see my Pilot face to face\
When I have crossed the bar.

> ***When I have crossed the bar,***\
> ***When I have crossed the bar,***\
> ***I hope to see my Pilot face to face***\
> ***When I have crossed the bar.***
