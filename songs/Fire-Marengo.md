description: >-
  Screwing cotton was one of the hardest tasks aboard ship: using jackscrews to
  compress and force bales of cotton into the hold until they were packed solid.
  There's no consensus on what 'Marengo' means.

Lift him up and carry him along\
***Fire Marengo, fire away!***\
Stow him down where he belongs\
***Fire Marengo, fire away!***

Ease him in and let him lay\
***Fire Marengo, fire away!***\
We'll screw him down and there he'll stay\
***Fire Marengo, fire away!***

Stow him down in the hold below\
***Fire Marengo, fire away!***\
Screw him down and then we'll go\
***Fire Marengo, fire away!***

When I get back to London town\
***Fire Marengo, fire away!***\
I'll pass my line to pretty Sally Brown\
***Fire Marengo, fire away!***

Screw the cotton, screw him down\
***Fire Marengo, fire away!***\
Bound away from Hilo Town\
***Fire Marengo, fire away!***

Thought I heard the old man say\
***Fire Marengo, fire away!***\
That's one last turn and then belay\
***Fire Marengo, fire away!***
