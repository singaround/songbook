>***Keep hauling on\
Mighty the jaws of morning\
War has made the billows roar\
As we keep hauling on***

We set sail like bold Phoenicians\
For the gold on the horizon\
Every soul lost to salvation\
Every song adieu adieu

Our captain is our lord and jailer\
For his wealth is our starvation\
Every face a mask of hunger\
Every song adieu adieu

>***Keep hauling on...***

When adrift between two harbours\
Night falls black upon the water\
Terror swims in every slumber\
Bidding dreams adieu adieu

With the morning wrapped in silver\
Rides a shadow in the water\
Eye as black as any cinder\
Bidding life adieu adieu

>***Keep hauling on\
Mighty the jaws of morning\
War has made the billows roar\
As we keep hauling on***

Still our souls are on that water\
Like white gulls caught by the weather\
Every siren singing danger\
Every song adieu adieu

>***Keep hauling on...***
