>***Hold the lantern high lad\
Hold the lantern high\
Catch your daddy's eye laddie\
Catch your daddy's eye***

Cullercoats Sands are cold and bare\
Many there must weep,\
Say a prayer for those who share\
The grief that they keep

>***Hold the lantern high lad...***

There's none but us to rue his loss,\
If he should not come home,\
They're safe in bed, they do not fuss,\
It's all the same to them

>***Hold the lantern high lad\
Hold the lantern high\
Catch your daddy's eye laddie\
Catch your daddy's eye***

Do not fear for you will hear\
His shouts across the bay\
Whether far or near, they will not fear\
Your lantern lights the way

>***Hold the lantern high lad...***

Safe on shore he's home once more,\
To sea he'll soon return,\
Whether far or near, he will not fear,\
As long as lanterns burn.

>***Hold the lantern high lad...***
