description: "In the 1990s, Canadian comedy-music group 'The Arrogant Worms' wrote a song called "The Last Saskatchewan Pirate". It is based on the absurd idea of a pirate crew forming in Saskatchewan, a landlocked province in Western Canada. The joke in the song was a crew of pirates who existed nowhere near the sea.

In the 2010s, Bristol-based folk band "[The Longest Johns](https://thelongestjohns.bandcamp.com/music)" rewrote it. Possibly entirely missing the point, they set the song in Bristol, famously a port city which was home to a lot of pirates. It didn't quite work for us.

So one of the Auntie Shanty crew has re-written it *again*, reclaiming it for a landlocked part of the world."
