  In the 1990s, Canadian comedy-music group [The Arrogant Worms](https://www.arrogantworms.com/) wrote a song called "The Last Saskatchewan Pirate". It is based on the absurd notion of a pirate crew forming in Saskatchewan, a landlocked province in Western Canada. The joke in the song was a crew of pirates who existed nowhere near the sea.
  
    In the 2010s, Bristol-based folk band "[The Longest Johns](https://thelongestjohns.bandcamp.com/music)" rewrote it. Possibly entirely missing the point, they chose to set the song in Bristol, a port city famous for pirates. That didn't quite work for us. 
  
    So now, in the 2020s, one of the Auntie Shanty crew has re-written it *again*, reclaiming the song for a landlocked part of the world.

Well I used to be a tutor, and I made a living fine,\
I had a bunch of students from noughth week 'til week nine\
But now it's the long vacation and the kids they just aren't there\
I've a book to finish editing and it's more than I can bear

I looked for every kind of job, the answer always no\
“Hire you now?” they’d always laugh, “we just let twenty go!”\
A summer school, they promised me a measly little sum\
But I’ve got too much pride to just move back in with my mum.\
So I thought, who gives a damn if all the jobs are gone?\
I'll be a pirate on the TOWPATH from Folly Bridge to Donnington!

>***And it’s a heave! ho! hi! ho! Cyclin’ round The Plain\
Stealin’ from the caravan that's in the other lane\
It’s a ho! hey! hi! hey! Houseboats batten down\
When you see the Jolly Roger flying proud through Oxford town***

Well, you’d think the local boaters would know that I’m at large\
But just the other day I found an unprotected barge\
I snuck up right behind them and they were none the wiser,\
I stole their wallets and their laptops but I left the fertilizer!

The bridge that's down by Christchurch spans the mighty river\
Townies cross in so much fear their stomachs are a’quiver\
Cause they know that Doctor Jack is hidin’ in the bay\
I’ll jump the bridge and knock them cold and you know I'll make them pay!

>***And it’s a heave! ho! hi! ho! Cyclin’ round The Plain\
Stealin’ from the caravan that's in the other lane\
It’s a ho! hey! hi! hey! Houseboats batten down\
When you see the Jolly Roger flying proud through Oxford town***

Well, Officer Bobby chased me, he was always at my throat\
But he called it theft and burglary cause I didn’t own a boat\
But cutbacks were a’coming and the copper lost his job\
So now he’s cycling with me, and I call him Salty Bob!

A swingin’ sword, a skull and bones and pleasant company\
I never pay my income tax; screw the VAT **(SCREW IT!!)**\
Pedalling down by Cowley Road, the scourge of Oxford East\
If you wanna get to Tesco boys, you gotta get by me!

>***And it’s a heave! ho! hi! ho! Cyclin’ round The Plain\
Stealin’ from the caravan that's in the other lane\
It’s a ho! hey! hi! hey! Houseboats batten down\
When you see the Jolly Roger flying proud through Oxford town***

Well, the pirate life’s appealing but you don't just find it here,\
I hear that down in Cambridge there’s a band of buccaneers\
They roam around the colleges from about the first of May\
And you’re gonna lose your mortarboard if you have to pass their way!

Well, winter is a’comin', I can feel it in my blood\
My pirate days are over once the river starts to flood\
I’ll be back after Hilary but for now I'll just sit tight\
I guess I'll have to do my pirating through breach of copyright!

>***And it’s a heave! ho! hi! ho! Cyclin’ round The Plain\
Stealin’ from the caravan that's in the other lane\
It’s a ho! hey! hi! hey! Houseboats batten down\
When you see the Jolly Roger flying proud through Oxford town***
