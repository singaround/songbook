In Frisco Bay there were three ships,\
***To me way, hey, hey, oh***\
In Frisco Bay there were three ships,\
***A long time ago***

And one of those ships was Noah's old ark,\
***To me way, hey, hey, oh***\
Covered all over with hickory bark.\
***A long time ago***

They took two animals of every kind\
***To me way, hey, hey, oh***\
They took two animals of every kind\
***A long time ago***

The bull and the cow they started to row,\
***To me way, hey, hey, oh***\
The bull and the cow they started to row\
***A long time ago***

Then said old Noah with a flick of his whip,\
***To me way, hey, hey, oh***\
Come stop this row or I'll scuttle the ship\
***A long time ago***

But the bull stuck his hoof through the side of the ark,\
***To me way, hey, hey, oh.***\
And the little black dog he started to bark\
***A long time ago***

So Noah took the dog, stuck its nose in the hole\
***To me way, hey, hey, oh***\
And ever since then, the dog's nose has been cold\
***A long time ago***

It's a long, long time, and a very long time\
***To me way, hey, hey, oh***\
A long, long time, and a very long time\
***A long time ago***
