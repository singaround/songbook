description: Much-overlooked 1980s punk-folk song about the Nore Mutiny of 1797. Performed by "The Men They Couldn't Hang" on their 1988 album "Waiting for Bonaparte"

I am a member of the council\
Of the naval mutiny\
I'm no traitor to my conscience\
Having done my sworn duty

These are my last words\
Before the scaffold\
And I charge you all to hear\
How a wretched British sailor\
Became a citizen mutineer

Pressed into service to carry powder\
I was loyal to the crack of the whip\
If I starved on the streets of Bristol,\
I starved worse on a British ship

>***Red is the colour of the new Republic\
Blue is the colour of the sea\
White is the colour of my innocence\
Not surrender to your mercy***

I was woken from my misery\
By the words of Thomas Paine\
On my barren soil they fell like\
The sweetest drops of rain

>***Red is the colour of the new Republic...***

So in the spring of the year we took the fleet\
Every cask and cannon and compass sheet\
And we flew a Jacobite flag to give us heart\
While Pitt stood helpless we were waiting for Bonaparte

>***Red is the colour of the new Republic...***

All you soldiers, all you sailors,\
All you labourers of the land\
All you beggars, all you builders,\
All you come here to watch me hang

To the masters we are the rabble,\
We are the 'swinish multitude'
But we can re-arrange the colours\
Of the red and the white and the blue

>***Red is the colour of the new Republic...***
