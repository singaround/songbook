Oh we'd be all right, if the wind was in our sails (x3)\
***And we'll all hang on behind***

> ***And we'll roll the old chariot along***\
> ***We'll roll the old chariot along***\
> ***And we'll roll the old chariot along***\
> ***And we'll all hang on behind***

Well a drop of Nelson's blood wouldn't do us any harm (x3)\
***And we'll all hang on behind***

Well a nights' watch below wouldn't do us any harm (x3)\
***And we'll all hang on behind***

Well a pot of Irish stew wouldn't do us any harm (x3)\
***And we'll all hang on behind***

Equal pay for equal work wouldn't do us any harm (x3)\
***And we'll all hang on behind***

...add your own!
