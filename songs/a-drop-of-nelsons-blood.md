Oh we'd be all right, if the wind was in our sails (x3)

***And we'll all hang on behind***

> ***And we'll roll the old chariot along***\
> ***We'll roll the old chariot along***\
> ***And we'll roll the old chariot along***\
> ***And we'll all hang on behind***

Well a drop of Nelson's blood wouldn't do us any harm (x3)

Well a nights' watch below wouldn't do us any harm (x3)

Well a pot of Irish stew wouldn't do us any harm (x3)

And no VAT on tampons wouldn't do us any harm (x3)

Equal pay for equal work wouldn't do us any harm (x3)

...add your own!
