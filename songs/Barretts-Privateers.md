 This is quite a long one, so if you decide to lead this, be prepared! It doesn't hurt to keep it pacey!

Oh, the year was 1778\
***How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now***\
A letter of marque came from the king\
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen

> ***God damn them all! I was told***\
> ***We'd cruise the seas for American gold***\
> ***We'd fire no guns, shed no tears***\
> ***Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier***\
> ***The last of Barrett's Privateers***

Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town\
***How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now***\
For twenty brave men all fishermen who\
Would make for him the Antelope's crew

> ***God damn them all! I was told...***

The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight\
***How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now***\
She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags\
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags

On the King's birthday we put to sea\
***How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now***\
We were ninety-one days to Montego Bay\
Pumping like madmen all the way

On the ninety-sixth day we sailed again\
***How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now***\
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight\
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight

Now the Yankee lay low down with gold\
***How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now***\
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays\
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days

Then at length we stood two cables away\
***How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now***\
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din\
But with one fat ball, the Yank stove us in

The Antelope shook and pitched on her side\
***How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now***\
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs\
And the main truck carried off both me legs

So here I lay in my twenty-third year\
***How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now***\
It's been six years since we sailed away\
And I just made Halifax yesterday
