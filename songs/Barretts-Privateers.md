Oh, the year was 1778\
_How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now_\
A letter of marque came from the king\
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen

> _God damn them all! I was told_\
> _We'd cruise the seas for American gold_\
> _We'd fire no guns, shed no tears_\
> _But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier_\
> _The last of Barrett's Privateers_

Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town\
_How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now_\
For twenty brave men all fishermen who\
Would make for him the Antelope's crew

> _God damn them all! I was told..._

The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight\
_How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now_\
She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags\
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags

On the King's birthday we put to sea\
_How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now_\
We were 91 days to Montego Bay\
Pumping like madmen all the way

On the 96th day we sailed again\
_How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now_\
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight\
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight

Now the Yankee lay low down with gold\
_How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now_\
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays\
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days

Then at length we stood two cables away\
_How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now_\
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din\
But with one fat ball, the Yank stove us in

The Antelope shook and pitched on her side\
_How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now_\
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs\
And the main truck carried off both me legs

So here I lay in my 23rd year\
_How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now_\
It's been 6 years since we sailed away\
And I just made Halifax yesterday
