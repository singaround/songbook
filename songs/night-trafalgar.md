In the wild October night-time\
When the wind raved round the land,\
And the Back-sea met the front-sea,\
And our doors were blocked with sand,\
And we heard the drub of dead-man's bay,\
Where the bones of thousands are,\
We knew not what the day had done\
For us at Trafalgar.

>***Had done,\
Had done,\
For us at Trafalgar\
Had done,\
Had done,\
For us at Trafalgar***

"Pull hard, and make the nothe,\
Or down we go!" one says, says he.\
We pulled; and bedtime brought the storm;\
But snug at home slept we.\
Yet all the while our gallants\
After fighting through the day,\
Were beating up and down the dark,\
Sou'west of Cadiz Bay.

>***The dark,\
The dark,\
Sou'west of Cadiz Bay\
The dark,\
The dark,\
Sou'west of Cadiz Bay***

The victors and the vanquished\
Then the storm it tossed and tore,\
As hard they strove, those worn-out men,\
Upon that surly shore;\
Dead Nelson and his half dead crew,\
His foes from near and far,\
Were rolled together on the deep\
That night at Trafalgar!

>***The deep,\
The deep,\
That night at Trafalgar\
The deep,\
The deep,\
That night at Trafalgar***
