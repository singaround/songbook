Farewell and adieu to you Spanish ladies\
Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain\
For we've received orders to sail for old England\
But we hope in a short while to see you again

> ***We'll rant and we'll roar like true British sailors\
We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas\
Until we strike soundings in the channel of Old England\
From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues***

We hove our ship to with the wind at Sou'west, boys\
We hove our ship to, our soundings to take\
So we rounded and sounded; got forty-five fathoms\
We squared our main yard and up channel did make

> ***We'll rant and we'll roar...***

Now the first land we sighted is called the Deadman\
Next Ram's Head off Plymouth, off Portland the Wight\
We sailed by Beachy, by Fairlee and Dungeness\
Till we came abreast of the South Foreland Light

> ***We'll rant and we'll roar...***

Then the order was made for the Grand Fleet to anchor\
All in the downs that night for to lie\
Let go your shank-painters, let go your cat-stoppers,\
Haul up your clew garnets, let tacks and sheets fly

> ***We'll rant and we'll roar...***

Now let every one toss off a full bumper\
And let every one drink off a full glass\
And we'll drink and be jolly and drown melancholy\
Singing, here's to the health to each true-hearted lass

> ***We'll rant and we'll roar...***
