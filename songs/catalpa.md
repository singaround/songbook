A noble whale ship and commander\
Was called the *Catalpa*, they say,\
She came down to Western Australia\
And she took six poor prisoners away\
***Away away, away away***

>***So come all you screws, warders and jailers,\
And remember Perth regatta day:\
Take good care of the rest of your prisoners, boys\
Or the whalers will steal them\
Away away, away away, away away, away***

Seven long years they had served here\
And seven long more had to stay,\
For defending their country, Old Ireland, they say\
For that they were banished away.\
***Away away***

You kept them in Western Australia\
Till their hair on their heads would turn grey,\
But the Yanks from the States of America\
Came out here and stole them away.\
***Away away, away away,\
away away, away away,\
away away, away away,\
away away, away***

And all the Perth boats are a-racing\
And making short tack for the spot,\
But the Yank she tacked into Fremantle\
And he took the best prize of the lot.

Then the *Georgette*, armed with bold warriors,\
Went out the poor Yanks to arrest.\
But she runs up her star-spangled banner,\
Saying, “You'll not arrest me, I guess.”

>***So come all you screws, warders and jailers,\
And remember Perth regatta day:\
Take good care of the rest of your prisoners, boys\
Or the whalers will steal them\
Away away, away away, away away, away***

And they've landed all safe in America\
And there they are able to cry,\
“Hoist up the green flag in The Shamrock,\
Hurrah for old Eire we'll die!

”So remember those six prisoners colonial\
And sing all of these verses with skill\
And remember the whaleship that stole them away\
And the home that they left on the hill
