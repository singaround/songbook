  "Three Score and Ten" is a broadside ballad commemorating a tragic storm off
  Grimsby and Hull in February 1889. With 9 vessels sunk and many men losing
  their lives, it remains one of the greatest disasters in the history of the
  towns. The song was composed by local fisherman William Delf to raise money
  for the affected families. 


  From the Hull Times, 2 March 1889: 


  "As day after day passes and no tidings arrive of the missing Grimsby smacks,
  it is beginning to be realised that the gale of the 9th ult. will prove one of
  the most disastrous to the Grimsby fishing trade on record. altogether nearly
  a dozen fishing vessels, carrying between 60 and 70 hands, are missing.


  Most of the vessels were provisioned for eight or nine days, and many of them
  have been out for over a month. Of the safety of seven of them all hope has
  now been abandoned."

Methinks I see a host of craft
Spreading their sails alee
Down the Humber they do glide
All bound for the Northern sea

Methinks I see on each small craft
A crew with hearts so brave
Going out to earn their daily bread
Upon the restless wave

>***And it's three score and ten\
Boys and men were lost from Grimsby town\
From Yarmouth down to Scarborough\
Many hundreds more were drowned\
Our herring craft, our trawlers\
Our fishing smacks, as well\
They long to fight the bitter night\
And battle with the swell***

Methinks I see them yet again\
As they leave this land behind\
Casting their nets into the sea\
The herring shoals to find\
\
Methinks I see them yet again\
They're all on board all right\
With their nets rolled up and their decks cleaned off\
And the side lights burning bright\
\
Methinks I've heard the Captain say\
"me lads we'll shorten sail"\
With the sky to all appearances\
Looks like an approaching gale\
\
Methinks I see them yet again\
The midnight hour is past\
The little craft abattling\
There against the icy blast

October's night brought such a sight\
'twas never seen before\
There were masts and yards and broken spars\
Awashed up on the shore

There were many a heart in sorrow\
Many a heart so brave\
There were many a fine and hearty lad\
That met a watery grave
