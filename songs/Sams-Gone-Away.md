I wish I was a cabin boy, aboard a Man O\'War

>Sam\'s gone away, aboard a Man O\'War

I wish I was a cabin boy, aboard a Man O\'War

>Sam\'s gone away, aboard a Man O\'War
Pretty work, brave boys
Pretty work, I say
Sam\'s gone away, aboard a Man O\'War

I wish I was the Bosun aboard a Man O\'War

I wish I was the Midshipman aboard a Man O\'War

I wish I was the Captain, aboard a Man O\'War

I wish I was the Admiral aboard a Man O\'War

I wish I was a sailor lass aboard a Man O\'War
