What shall we do with the drunken sailor

>What shall we do with the drunken sailor
What shall we do with the drunken sailor
Early in the morning
Weigh heigh and up she rises
Weigh heigh and up she rises
Weigh heigh and up she rises

Early in the morning

Put him in the long boat till he\'s sober

Put him in the long-boat and make him bail her

Put him in the Scuppers with a hose-pipe on him

Heave him by the leg in a runnin\' Bowline

Give \'im a hair of the dog that bit him

Put him in the Bilge and make him drink it

Shave his belly with a rusty razor
