Where are you goin\' my Billy-O?

Where are you goin\' my Billy-O?

I\'m joining a ship in Scapa Flow,

That\'s where I\'m going my Nancy

I\'m joining \"Queen Mary\" Nancy-O

Joining \"Queen Mary\" Nancy-O

She\'s bristling with guns and ready to go

To sail to glory with Jellicoe

But where is \"Queen Mary\"? Gone Now!

And where is the glory? Gone Now!

And six thousand sailors, Gone Now!

They have gone to the bottom at Jutland.

Where are you goin\' my Rodney-O?

Where are you goin\' my Rodney-O?

I\'m joining a ship in Scapa Flow

That\'s where I\'m going my Nancy

I\'m joining \"Invincible\" Nancy-O

Joining \"Invincible\" Nancy-O

She\'s bristling with guns and ready to go

To sail to glory with Jellicoe

But where is \"Invincible\"? Gone Now!

And where is the glory? Gone Now!

And six thousand sailors, Gone Now!

They have gone to the bottom at Jutland.

Where are you goin\' my Johnny-O?

Where are you goin\' my Johnny-O?

I\'m joining a ship in Scapa Flow

That\'s where I\'m going my Nancy

I\'m joining the \"Black Prince\" Nancy-O

Joining the \"Black Prince\" Nancy-O

She\'s bristling with guns and ready to go

To sail to glory with Jellicoe

But where is the \"Black Prince\"? Gone Now!

And where is the glory? Gone Now!

And six thousand sailors, Gone Now!

They have gone to the bottom at Jutland.
