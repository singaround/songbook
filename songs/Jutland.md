  This modern shanty by Les Sullivan explores
  the fate of various ships which fought in the Battle of Jutland in 1916, the
  largest fleet action of the First World War, which led to huge loss of life on
  both the British and German sides. Queen Mary, Invincible, and Black Prince
  were three of the British battleships which were lost. This song can be found
  on the album, and Les has kindly given us permission to reproduce the lyrics here.
