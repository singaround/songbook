We come on the sloop John B\
My Grandfather and me\
Around Nassau town we did roam\
Drinkin' all night\
Got into a fight\
Well, I feel so broke up and I want to go home

> _Hoist up the John B's sails_
> _See how the main sails set_
> _Call for the captain ashore, let me go home_
> _Let me go home_
> _I want to go home_
> _Well, I feel so broke up, I want to go home_

First mate, he got drunk\
Broke up the people's trunk\
Constable had to come and take him away\
Sheriff John Stone\
Why don't you leave me alone?\
Well, I feel so broke up and I want to go home

Well, the poor cook he caught the fits\
Threw away all of my grits\
Then he took and he ate up all of my corn\
Let me go home\
I want to go home\
This is the worst trip I've ever been on
