We come on the sloop John B\
My Grandfather and me\
Around Nassau town we did roam\
Drinkin' all night\
Got into a fight\
Well, I feel so broke up and I want to go home

> ***Hoist up the John B's sails\
See how the main sails set\
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home\
Let me go home\
I want to go home\
Well, I feel so broke up, I want to go home***

First mate, he got drunk\
Broke up the people's trunk\
Constable had to come and take him away\
Sheriff John Stone\
Why don't you leave me alone?\
Well, I feel so broke up and I want to go home

> ***Hoist up the John B's sails...***

Well, the poor cook he caught the fits\
Threw away all of my grits\
Then he took and he ate up all of my corn\
Let me go home\
I want to go home\
This is the worst trip I've ever been on

> ***Hoist up the John B's sails\
See how the main sails set\
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home\
Let me go home\
I want to go home\
Well, I feel so broke up, I want to go home***
