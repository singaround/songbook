description: >-
  High Barbary refers to the Rif coast of North Africa, home to Ottoman and
  Maghrebi 'barbary pirates' who operated out of the ports of Sal√©, Rabat,
  Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, seizing merchant ships in the Mediterranean and
  Eastern North Atlantic, and taking slaves in coastal raids. This song
  celebrates a victory of two English ships over one of the Barbary pirates.

There were two lofty ships from old England came\
***Blow high, blow low and so sail we***\
One was the Prince of Luther, the other Prince of Wales\
***All a-cruisin' down the coast of High Barbary*** 

Aloft there, aloft there our jolly bosun cried\
***Blow high, blow low and so sail we***\
Look ahead, look astern, look to weather an' a-lee\
***All a-cruisin' down the coast of High Barbary*** 

There's naught upon the stern, sir, there's naught upon our lee\
***Blow high, blow low and so sail we***\
But there's a lofty ship to wind'ard, an' she's sailin' fast and
free\
***All a-cruisin' down the coast of High Barbary*** 

Oh hail her, oh hail her, our gallant captain cried\
***Blow high, blow low and so sail we***\
Are you a man-o-war, or a privateer? cried he\
***All a-cruisin' down the coast of High Barbary*** 

Oh, I'm not a man-o-war, nor privateer, said he\
***Blow high, blow low and so sail we***\
But I am salt sea pirate all a-looking for me fee\
***All a-cruisin' down the coast of High Barbary*** 

For Broadside, for broadside a long time we lay\
***Blow high, blow low and so sail we***\
'Til at last the Prince of Luther shot the pirate's mast away\
***All a-cruisin' down the coast of High Barbary*** 

Oh quarter, oh quarter those pirates they did cry\
***Blow high, blow low and so sail we***\
But the quarter that we gave them was we sank 'em in the sea\
***All a-cruisin' down the coast of High Barbary***
