description: >-
  High Barbary refers to the Rif coast of North Africa, home to Ottoman and
  Maghrebi 'barbary pirates' who operated out of the ports of Salé, Rabat,
  Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, seizing merchant ships in the Mediterranean and
  Eastern North Atlantic, and taking slaves in coastal raids. This song
  celebrates a victory of two English shops over one of the Barbary pirates.

There were two lofty ships from old England came

_Blow high, blow low and so sail we_

One was the Prince of Luther, the other Prince of Wales

_All a-cruisin' down the coast of High Barbary_ 

Aloft there, aloft there our jolly bosun cried\
Look ahead, look astern, look to weather an' a-lee\
\
There's naught upon the stern, sir, there's naught upon our lee\
But there's a lofty ship to wind'ard, an' she's sailin' fast and
free

Oh hail her, oh hail her, our gallant captain cried\
Are you a man-o-war, or a privateer? cried he\
\
Oh, I'm not a man-o-war, nor privateer, said he\
But I am salt sea pirate all a-looking for me fee

For Broadside, for broadside a long time we lay\
'Til at last the Prince of Luther shot the pirate's mast away\
\
Oh quarter, oh quarter those pirates they did cry\
But the quarter that we gave them was we sank 'em in the sea
