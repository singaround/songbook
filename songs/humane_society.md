Come, listen to the news\
Of the City of Columbus and her pleasure cruise\
To Florida from Boston sailed\
Smack into a winter's gale\
With freezing rain and frozen hail
>***'Tis true***

And, at the Gay Head light,\
The keeper there awoke to face a fearsome sight\
On Devil's Bridge she'd run aground\
The breakers playing lost and found\
With the drowning and the drowned.
>***'Tis true***

And he sent out a plea,\
To the worthy men of the Humane Society,\
The call went out both loud and clear\
To us, lifesaving volunteers.\
And I could see my duty clear.
>***'Tis true***

My boots left on the ice,\
The socks my mother knitted me they would suffice\
Don't need my boots to weigh me down\
If it is my day to drown\
My brother there could use the pair.
>***'Tis true***

Six men to a boat,\
The call to pull away it came as from one throat\
As if one hand did time the oars\
Our backs turned to the ocean's roar,\
The surf did throw us back once more
>***'Tis true***

Our steersman gave a shout:\
Each able bodied man to leap right out\
Heave the boat along the side\
Force her though the surging tide.\
Soaked to the skin, we launched her in
>***'Tis true***

And froze up to our necks,\
We rowed for love of life out to that sinking wreck\
Some were lashed onto the mast,\
Some in the rigging holding fast,\
Praying not to be the last.
>***'Tis true***

And, how to understand\
These gentlemen who do not shake an Indian's hand?\
To meet on any other day\
Would not have one word to say\
Were reaching out as they did pray.
>***'Tis true***

Some twenty-nine we saved\
One hundred three did perish beneath the waves\
The bloated bodies of the dead\
Washed on the beaches of Gay Head\
Like stranded whales to no avail.
>***'Tis true***

Now, we're heroic men,\
With medals and with money for our courage then\
The centuries most tragic wreck\
The rescued ones do not suspect,\
We do it for our self respect.
>***'Tis true***
