  This is a song about the Kamchatka bowhead whale and Pacific sperm whale
  fishing in the 1850s. The Pacific whalers used to meet on Maui or in nearby
  Oahu twice a year. In March they fitted out for the summer season in the
  Arctic, when they fished the bowhead grounds off Kamchatka and the Gulf on
  Anadyr. In November, they returned to fit out for sperm-whaling in the
  tropical and subtropical waters of the Southern Seas.


  Some versions have unfortunate lyrics about 'native maids', which we have
  avoided here.

It's a damn tough life full of toil and strife
We whalermen undergo
And we don't give a damn when the day is done
How hard the winds did blow\
'cause we're homeward bound from the Arctic ground
With a good ship, taut and free
And we don't give a damn when we drink our rum
With the girls of old Maui

>***Rolling down to old Maui, me boys***\
***Rolling down to old Maui***\
***We're homeward bound from the Arctic ground***\
***Rolling down to old Maui***

Once more we sail with a northerly gale\
Towards our island home.\
Our mainmast sprung, our whaling done\
And we ain't got far to roam\
Six hellish months we passed away\
On the cold Kamchatka sea\
But now we're bound from the Arctic ground\
Rolling down to old Maui.

>***Rolling down to old Maui...***

Once more we sail with a northerly gale\
Through the ice and wind and rain\
Them coconut fronds, them tropical lands\
We soon shall see again\
Our stu'n's'l booms is carried away\
What care we for that sound?\
A living gale is after us\
Thank God we're homeward bound

>***Rolling down to old Maui, me boys***\
***Rolling down to old Maui***\
***We're homeward bound from the Arctic ground***\
***Rolling down to old Maui***

An ample share of toil and care\
We whalemen undergo,\
But when it’s over, what care we\
How bitter the blast may blow?\
We’re homeward bound\
That joyful sound across the Arctic sea,\
We’re homeward bound from the Arctic ground\
Rolling down to old Maui.

>***Rolling down to old Maui...***
