I've never sailed the Amazon,\
Nor ever reached Brazil;\
But the Don and Magdalena,\
They go there when they will!

Yes, weekly from Southampton,\
Great steamers, white and gold, \
Go rolling down to Rio\
(Roll downâ€”roll down to Rio!)\
I'd like to roll to Rio\
Some day before I'm old!\
Yes I'd like to roll to Rio\
Some day before I'm old!
