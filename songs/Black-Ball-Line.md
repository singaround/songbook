In the Black Ball line I served my time\
***To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh***\
And that's the line where you can shine\
***Hurrah for the Black Ball Line***

The Black Ball Ships are good and true\
***To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh***\
They are the ships for me and you\
***Hurrah for the Black Ball Line***

For once there was a Black Ball ship\
***To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh***\
That fourteen knots an hour could clip\
***Hurrah for the Black Ball Line***

They'll carry you along through frost and snow\
***To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh***\
And take you where the wind don't blow\
***Hurrah for the Black Ball Line***

You will surely find a rich gold mine\
***To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh***\
Just take a trip in the Black Ball Line\
***Hurrah for the Black Ball Line***

Just take a trip to Liverpool\
***To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh***\
To Liverpool, that Yankee school\
***Hurrah for the Black Ball Line***

The Yankee sailors you'll see there\
***To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh***\
With red-top boots and short-cut hair\
***Hurrah for the Black Ball Line***

At Liverpool docks we bid adieu\
***To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh***\
To friends and loves, but still sing true\
***Hurrah for the Black Ball Line***
