We think she stole Black Caesar's rig\
He kept it in the Keys\
She cut away the anchor rope\
And flew off in the breeze\
With a hundred hearty cutthroats\
I know it sounds absurd\
She ran the brig to Martinique\
Past that we haven't heard

> ***She'll steal the pennies off your eyes before your corpse is cold***\
> ***And wear your guts as garters before your shirt's been sold***\
> ***But generous to a fault, they say she'd give away her coat***\
> ***And if you're caught asleep on watch, she'll slit your bloody throat***

The Spanish were full terrified\
She'd cleaned off all their decks\
And carried off the gold and plate\
And left them nervous wrecks\
The Brits were apprehensive\
For fear she'd come in view\
The pirate queen would pick them clean\
Before they'd quite hove to

> ***She'll steal the pennies off your eyes...***

Anne Bonny is a terror\
She'll swing you from the yards\
Or throw you aft as shark bait\
Or slice you into shards\
For all that, she's a beauty\
And generous with her charms\
Vanquished men have 'riz' again\
For one night in her arms

> ***She'll steal the pennies off your eyes...***
