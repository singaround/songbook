>I'll sail and I'll sail\
***I'll sail and I'll sail***\
I'll sail and I'll sail\
***I'll sail and I'll sail***

I'll sail and I'll sail and wherever I go\
Where the waters are high or the pulleys are low\
I'll follow the trade winds wherever they go\
***And trust in the rolling ocean***

I'll sail and I'll sail and I'll leave this behind\
Though the crossing be cruel and the currents unkind\
I'll open my heart to whatever I find\
***And trust in the rolling ocean***

I'll sail and I'll sail and wherever I land\
I'll gather the bones and the stones in my hand\
And count all my blessings like grains in the sand\
***And trust in the rolling ocean***

>I'll sail and I'll sail...

I'll sail and I'll sail and wherever I roam\
I pray for the frigate that slices the foam\
And long for the moss and the meadow of home\
***And trust in the rolling ocean***
