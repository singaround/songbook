I thought I heard our captain say

Pay me my money down

Tomorrow is our sailing day

Pay me my money down

Pay me, Oh pay me

Pay me my money down

Pay me or go to jail

Pay me my money down

Soon as the boat was clear of the bar

He knocked me down with the end of a spar

I wish I was Mr Howard\'s son,

Sit in the house and drink good rum,

I wish I was Mr Steven\'s son

Sit on the bank and watch the work done,
