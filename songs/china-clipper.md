O fair she was to look on, as some spirit of the sea\
When she raced from China, homeward, with her freight of fragrant tea\
And the shining swift bonito and the wide-winged albatross\
Claimed kinship with the clipper beneath the Southern Cross

Close-hauled, with shortened canvas, swift and plunging she could sweep\
Through the gale that rose to bar her wild pathway across the deep;\
And before the gale blew over, half her drenched and driven crew\
To the tune of Reuben Ranzo, hoisted topsail yards anew

From the haven of the present she has cleared and slipped away\
Loaded deep and running free for the port of yesterday\
And the cargo that she carried, ah! it was not China tea\
She took with her all the wonder and romance of the sea.
