Farewell to you my own true love\
I'm going far away\
I'm bound for California\
But I know that I'll return some day

>***So fare thee well, my own true love\
When I return, united we will be\
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me\
But my darling when I think of thee***

Farewell to Prince's Landing Stage\
River Mersey, fare thee well\
I am bound for California\
A place I know right well 

>***So fare thee well...***

I'm bound for California \
By the way of stormy Cape Horn\
And I promise to write you a letter, love\
When I am homeward bound 

>***So fare thee well, my own true love\
When I return, united we will be\
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me\
But my darling when I think of thee***

I have signed on a Yankee clipper ship\
Davy Crockett is her name\
And Burgess is the captain of her\
And they say she's a floating shame

>***So fare thee well...***

I have sailed with Burgess once before\
And I think I know him well\
If a man's a seaman, he can get along\
If not, then he's sure in Hell 

>***So fare thee well, my own true love\
When I return, united we will be\
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me\
But my darling when I think of thee***

Farewell to lower Frederick Street\
Ensign Terrace and Park Lane\
For I think it will be a long, long time\
Before I see you again 

>***So fare thee well...***

Oh the sun is on the harbour, love\
And I wish I could remain\
For I know it will be a long, long time\
until I see you again 

>***So fare thee well...***
