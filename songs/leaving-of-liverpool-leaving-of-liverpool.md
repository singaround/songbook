Farewell to you my own true love\
I'm going far away\
I'm bound for California\
but I know that I'll return some day

***So fare thee well, my own true love***\
***When I return, united we will be***\
***It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me*** \
***But my darling when I think of thee***

Farewell to Prince's Landing Stage \
River Mersey, fare thee well \
I am bound for California \
A place I know right well 

***So fare thee well, my own true love***\
***When I return, united we will be***\
I***t's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me*** \
***But my darling when I think of thee***

I'm bound for California \
By the way of stormy Cape Horn \
And I promise to write you a letter, love \
When I am homeward bound 

***So fare thee well...***

I have signed on a Yankee clipper ship \
Davy Crockett is her name \
And Burgess is the captain of her\
And they say she's a floating shame

***So fare thee well...***

I have sailed with Burgess once before \
And I think I know him well \
If a man's a seaman, he can get along \
If not, then he's sure in Hell 

***So fare thee well...***

Farewell to lower Frederick Street \
Ensign Terrace and Park Lane \
For I think it will be a long, long time \
Before I see you again 

***So fare thee well...***

Oh the sun is on the harbour, love \
And I wish I could remain \
For I know it will be a long, long time \
until I see you again 

***So fare thee well...***
