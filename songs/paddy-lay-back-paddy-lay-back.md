'Twas a cold an' dreary mornin' in December **(December!)**\
Well, all of me money it was spent **(spent! spent!)**\
Where it went to, Lord, I barely can't remember **(remember!)**\
So down to the shippin' office went **(went! went!)**

>Paddy lay back ***(Paddy lay back)***\
Take in your slack ***(take in your slack)***\
***Take a turn around the capstan, heave a-pawl*** (heave a-pawl!)\
***About ship's station boys be handy*** (be handy!)\
***For we're off to Valparaiso round the Horn***

That day there was a great demand for sailors **(for sailors!)**\
For the colonies, for Frisco, and for France **(France! France!)**\
So I shipped aboard a Limey bark, 'The Hotspur' **(The Hotspur!)**\
And I got paralytic drunk on my advance **(vance! vance!)**

>Paddy lay back ***(Paddy lay back)***...

There were Dutchmen, Spaniards, and Russians **(Russians!)**\
And jolly boys just across from France **(France! France!)**\
Not a one of them could speak a word of English **(of English!)**\
But the answered to the name of 'Month's Advance' **(vance! vance!)**

>Paddy lay back ***(Paddy lay back)***\
Take in your slack ***(take in your slack)***\
***Take a turn around the capstan, heave a-pawl*** (heave a-pawl!)\
***About ship's station boys be handy*** (be handy!)\
***For we're off to Valparaiso round the Horn***

Now some of the lads they had been drinkin' **(drinkin'!)**\
And meself was heavy on the booze  **(booze! booze!)**\
So I sat upon my old sea-chest a-thinkin' **(a-thinkin!)**\
That I'd crawl into me bunk and have a snooze **(snooze! snooze!)**

>Paddy lay back ***(Paddy lay back)***...

I woke up in the morning sick and sore **(sick and sore!)**\
For I knew I was outward bound again **('gain! 'gain!)**\
When I heard a voice bawling at the door **(the door!)**\
Get up ye bastard and listen to your name  **(name, name)**

>Paddy lay back ***(Paddy lay back)***\
Take in your slack ***(take in your slack)***\
***Take a turn around the capstan, heave a-pawl*** (heave a-pawl!)\
***About ship's station boys be handy*** (be handy!)\
***For we're off to Valparaiso round the Horn***

ðŸ”¹Well I wish I was in the Jolly Farmers **(the Farmers!)**\
Along with Irish navvies drinkin' beer **(beer, beer!)**\
When I thought what jolly lads were sailors **(were sailors!)**\
And with me flipper I wiped away a tear **(tear, tear!)**

>Paddy lay back ***(Paddy lay back)***...
