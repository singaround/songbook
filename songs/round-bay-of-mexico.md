>***Round the Bay of Mexico\
Way up Suzianna\
Mexico is the place that I belong in\
Round the Bay of Mexico***

Been to sea for a month or more\
***Way up Suzyanna***\
Lookin' forward to my time on shore\
***Round the Bay of Mexico***

>***Round the Bay of Mexico...***

The wind is high, the sky is blue\
***Way up Suzianna***\
Bound to anchor in a day or two\
***Round the Bay of Mexico***

>***Round the Bay of Mexico...***

I can see it all before my eye\
***Way up Suzianna***\
A big cafÃ© and a bottle full o' rye\
***Round the Bay of Mexico***

>***Round the Bay of Mexico...***

Some beans and rice to soothe my taste\
***Way up Suzianna***\
I ain't gonna let nothin' go to waste\
***Round the Bay of Mexico***

>***Round the Bay of Mexico...***
