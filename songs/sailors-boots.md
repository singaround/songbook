If I had been born two hundred years ago,\
I would have been a sailor, a-sailing I would go.\
I'd sail around the Capes and across the Seven Seas and then back home,\
If I had been born two hundred years ago.

And I would know the waters, and the waters would know me.\
I would cut across the waves, and be as happy as can be.\
I'd be landless, I'd be loveless, I'd be flight and fancy-free.\
I would know the waters, and the waters would know me.

When I think about the place and time where I was born,\
I wonder if the hands of fate have slipped and placed me wrong,\
Because there are ships I could have sailed and sailors boots I could have worn,\
When I think about the place and time where I was born.

But the ocean is still out there, magnificent and wide.\
She's got open arms to hold me, and endless space to hide,\
And the only things that hold me back are things I hold inside,\
The ocean is still out there, magnificent and wide.

A-sailing I should go.
