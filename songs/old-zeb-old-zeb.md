I'm not tired of the wind, I'm not weary of the sea,\
But she's prob'ly had a bellyfull of a damned old coot like me.\
I'm bound a-shore, she's gone for better days,\
But I'll see her topsail flyin' when I come down off the way.

> ***Rosie, get my Sunday shoes,\
Gertie get my walkin' cane.\
We'll take another walk to see\
Old Alice sail again.***

Wish I had a nickel for the men I used to know\
Who could load three cords of lumber in half an hour or so.\
Who could put on sail by hauling, 'stead of donkeyin' around.\
Then I'd be the poorest coasterman this side of Edgartown.

> ***Rosie, get my Sunday shoes...***
 
Any fool can run an engine, it takes brains to work a sail,\
I've never seen no steamer make much good out of a gale.\
You can go and pay your taxes on the rationed gas you get;\
But at least to me, the wind is free, and they haven't run out yet.

> ***Rosie, get my Sunday shoes...***

If I ever get back to her, you know I'd treat her just the same:\
Drive her when I want to, I'd sail in freezing rain.\
Park old Alice on the beach, and go dancin' in the town,\
Cause a man who's fit for hangin' prob'ly never will get drowned.

> ***Rosie, get my Sunday shoes...***
