O shipmates as you lay sleeping\
***Blow, boys, blow!***\
Across the world the day came creeping\
***Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!***\
With a cold wet wind the shrouds were shaking,\
And in all the port was no one waking,\
In the morning watch and the grey dawn breaking\
***Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!***
 
I saw a ship come down the river\
***Blow, boys, blow!***\
In the morning light her sails did shiver\
***Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!***\
I saw the sun on her royals gleaming\
And her gilded trucks in the dawn a-gleaming,\
And the bubbled foam of her bow-wave streaming —\
***Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!***
 
I heard the gulls all round her calling\
***Blow, boys, blow!***\
I heard the watch on the braces hauling\
***Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!***\
I heard their voices over the water —\
'O Shenandoah, I love your daughter' —\
And the dash o' the tide on her weather quarter\
***Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!***

Then like a cloud she broke and lifted\
***Blow, boys, blow!***\
Her spars did melt, her sails they drifted\
***Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!***\
And all that I saw was a white mist flying,\
All that I heard, the grey gulls crying,\
<span style="color:blue">And the tide's sob and the wind's sighing</span>\
<span style="color:blue">And one far call out of dreams replying</span>\
***Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!***
