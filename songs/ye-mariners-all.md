---
Ye mariners all, as ye pass by,\
Come in and drink when you are dry.\
Come spend, my lads, your money brisk,\
***And pop your nose in a jug of this!***

Ye tipplers all, as ye pass by,\
Come in and drink when you are dry.\
Come spend, my lads, your money brisk,\
***And pop your nose in a jug of this!***

Ye tipplers all, if ye’ve half a crown,\
You’re welcome all for to sit down.\
Come in, sit down, think not amiss,\
***To pop your nose in a jug of this!***

Oh now I’m old and can scarcely crawl,\
I’ve a long grey beard and a head that’s bald.\
Crown my desire, fulfil my bliss,\
***A pretty girl and a jug of this!***

Oh when I’m in my grave and dead,\
And all my sorrows are past and fled,\
Transform me then into a fish,\
***And let me swim in a jug of this!***

Ye mariners all, as ye pass by,\
Come in and drink when you are dry.\
Come in, sit down, think naught amiss,\
***To pop your nose in a jug of this!***
