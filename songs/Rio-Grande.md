Our ship is a-sailing out over the Bar\
***'way down Rio***\
We're pointing her bow to the Southern Star\
***And we're bound for the Rio Grande***

>***Then away, boys, away\
'way down Rio\
So fare thee well, my bonny young girl\
We're bound for the Rio Grande***

Say was you ever down Rio Grande?\
***'way down Rio***\
It's there that the river flows down golden sand!\
***And we're bound for the Rio Grande***

>***Then away, boys, away...***

It's pack up your donkeys an' get underway,\
***'way down Rio***\
Them Judies we're leaving will draw half our pay\
***And we're bound for the Rio Grande***

>***Then away, boys, away...***

We've a bully good ship & a bully good crew,\
***'way down Rio***\
A bully good mate and a good skipper too\
***And we're bound for the Rio Grande***

>***Then away, boys, away\
'way down Rio\
So fare thee well, my bonny young girl\
We're bound for the Rio Grande***


>***Then away, boys, away...***

Cheer up, Mary Ellen, and don't look so glum,\
***'way down Rio***\
On white-stocking day you'll be drinking hot rum\
***And we're bound for the Rio Grande***

>***Then away, boys, away...***

So lift up your glasses and sing fare thee well\
***'way down Rio***\
There's a bonny young lass there to love you so well\
***And we're bound for the Rio Grande***

>***Then away, boys, away...***
