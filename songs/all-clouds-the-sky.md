All clouds the sky\
The boats are leaving\
One last goodbye\
Dark waters call us on\
The Northern Sea\
Knows well the sound of grieving\
How slight the fate\
We put our trust upon

>***Then go we must\
No longer can we tarry\
The water's wide\
Yet we must go and try\
And like a bird on a silvery morning\
Home to your side we will chance to fly***

And the watеr shines like patent lеather\
We search for signs upon this lifeless ground\
The reckoning sky calls down some heavy weather\
We've come for fish, and fish need must be found

>***Then go we must...***

And we ride the flood and trust to glory\
Some planks of wood no thicker than your thumb\
It's all that keeps the telling of the story\
From being lost or maybe being won

>***Then go we must...***

All clouds the sky\
The boats are leaving\
One last goodbye\
Dark waters call us on\
The Northern Sea\
Knows well the sound of grieving\
How slight the fate\
We put our trust upon

>***Then go we must...***
