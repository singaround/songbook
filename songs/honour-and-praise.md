On a fine summer's morning as we lay at the quay\
While our holds were filled high with the treasures of the sea\
So that they could be transported by men such as we\
To homeland and the Queen

When the loading was done, we hoisted full sail\
Prayed for good winds to guide us and deliverance from gales\
And the thoughts of the crew turned to home and strong ale\
As we cast off the ropes and set sail

>***I for honour and for praise\
Sailed the sea throughout me days\
In cold ground I'll never lay\
I'd rather die on the ocean\
I'd rather die on the ocean***

Thirty days out to sea and the weather was fine\
The wind that we'd prayed for and making good time\
Well the honour of first home was soon to be mine\
For homeland and the Queen

But the night became stormy and the wind changed our course\
A gale was a-blowing and the wind gathered force\
And I wondered if ever we would reach our home port\
Or if we'd all be lost in the storm

>***I for honour and for praise\
Sailed the sea throughout me days\
In cold ground I'll never lay\
I'd rather die on the ocean\
Rather die on the ocean***

Well, the waves washed the deck, in the wind we were locked\
I fought with the wheel to stay clear of the rocks\
But the fighting's in vain, in the storm we were lost\
And our prayers blew away on the wind

Well, I coughed and I choked and I tasted the sea\
I looked over the sand, there was no one but me\
And I knew that the might of the sea had finished me\
And I wished that I'd drowned in the storm

>***I for honour and for praise\
Sailed the sea throughout me days\
In cold ground I'll never lay\
I'd rather die on the ocean\
Rather die on the ocean***

And I've lived with the thought for the rest of me days\
That I'd given the lives of the crew just to pay\
In search of the garlands of honour and praise\
And I wish that I'd drowned in the storm

>***I for honour and for praise\
Sailed the sea throughout me days\
In cold ground I'll never lay\
I'd rather die on the ocean\
Rather die on the ocean***
