---
***Oh the weary cutters, they’ve taken my laddie from me,\
Oh the weary cutters, they’ve taken my laddie from me.***\
They’ve pressed him far away foreign with Nelson all on the salt sea,\
Oh the weary cutters, they’ve taken my laddie from me.

***Oh the weary cutters, they’ve taken my laddie from me,\
Oh the weary cutters, they’ve taken my laddie from me.***\
They aalwes come in the neet, they nivor come in the day,\
They aalwes come in the neet to steal the laddies away.

***Oh the weary cutters, they’ve taken my laddie from me,\
Oh the weary cutters, they’ve taken my laddie from me.***\
And when I looked to the North I looked with a tear in my eye,\
But when I looked to the south, I seen my laddie go by.

***Oh the weary cutters, they’ve taken my laddie from me,\
Oh the weary cutters, they’ve taken my laddie from me.***\
I’ll give the cutters a guinea, I can’t gie the cutters no more,\
I’ll give the cutters a guinea to steal my laddie ashore.

***Oh the weary cutters, they’ve taken my laddie from me,\
Oh the weary cutters, they’ve taken my laddie from me.***
