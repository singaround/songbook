Oh we'd be all right, if the wind was in our sails (x3)

_And we'll all hang on behind_

>_And we'll roll the old chariot along_
>_We'll roll the old chariot along_
>_And we'll roll the old chariot along_
>_And we'll all hang on behind_

Well a drop of Nelson's blood wouldn't do us any harm (x3)

Well a nights' watch below wouldn't do us any harm (x3)

Well a pot of Irish stew wouldn't do us any harm (x3)

And no VAT on tampons wouldn't do us any harm (x3)

Equal pay for equal work wouldn't do us any harm (x3)

...add your own!
