  A traditional song of farewell and emigration. Some singers enjoy the long
  'FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR' in the last line of the refrain and some don't - watch
  the leader so you're not caught unawares!

Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme\
Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine\
Come lift up your voices, all grief to refrain\
For we may or might never all meet here again

> ***So here's a health to the company and one to my lass***\
> ***Let's drink and be merry all out of one glass***\
> ***Let's drink and be merry, all grief to refrain***\
> ***For we may or might never all meet here again***

Here's a health to the wee lass that I love so well\
For style and for beauty there's none can excel\
There's a smile on her countenance as she sits upon my knee\
There is no man in this wide world as happy as me

> ***So here's a health to the company and one to my lass...***

Our ship lies at anchor, she is ready to dock\
I wish her safe landing without any shock\
And if ever I should meet you by land or by sea\
I will always remember your kindness to me

> ***So here's a health to the company and one to my lass...***
