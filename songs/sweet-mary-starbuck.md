I married John Coffin just two years ago\
And he’s a fine man, as all Nantucket knows\
And he’s bound to make second mate, or so I hear\
If the Charles brings home enough oil next year 

At twenty a mother, at nineteen a bride\
With a child on my knee and another inside\
My heart it was broken, and swept out to sea\
Where my sweet Mary found it and brought it to me

>***Sweet Mary Starbuck from Nantucket town\
If she were the sea I would willingly drown\
And her voice like a bell on a clear winter’s day\
Sets my heart a-ringing and winging away***

At meeting one morning she came to me there\
With the Nantucket wind in her flyaway hair\
Her hand, soft and certain, clasped mine in the lane\
And I felt my heart shiver when she spoke my name 

Her words came in whispers, in trembling lines\
Her cheeks red as roses, her eyes all a-shine\
Then she kissed me so gently, so soft and so sure\
The world spun round once, and at once I was hers 

>***Sweet Mary Starbuck from Nantucket town\
If she were the sea I would willingly drown\
And her voice like a bell on a clear winter’s day\
Sets my heart a-ringing and winging away***

On Nantucket our men go to hunt for the whale\
And they live at the mercy of teeth, sea, and gale\
But in town life goes on, and it goes on apace\
With children, and letters, and Mary’s sweet face

So when John comes I’ll give him a kiss and a smile\
And a good whaleman’s wife I will be for a while\
And in time I’ll stand watching his sail fade at sea\
Then go home where my true love lies waiting for me

>***Sweet Mary Starbuck from Nantucket town\
If she were the sea I would willingly drown\
And her voice like a bell on a clear winter’s day\
Sets my heart a-ringing and winging away***
