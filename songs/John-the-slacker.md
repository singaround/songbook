  We love this song! We originally learnt it as "John Kanaka".


  But... 'kanaka' is a word from the Hawai'ian for man, which came to be used in
  English to describe workers from the Pacific Islands who were employed by
  their colonisers. Sadly, in Australia it is a charged and hateful racist term,
  where descendants of kanakas are recognised to be even more disadvantaged than
  indigenous populations. This song gives some specific racial identity to
  complaints of mistreatment on the ocean, with a cheery melody.


  We're not sure what to do with this one - we liked what the [London Sea Shanty
  Collective](https://londonseashantycollective.com/) had done with it at a
  recent workshop, replacing 'John Kanaka' with 'John, the slacker', so we've
  adopted that

I thought I heard the old man say\
***John, the slacker, slacker, too lie ay***\
Today, today is a holiday\
***John, the slacker, slacker, too lie ay***

> ***Too lie ay, oh, to lie ay\
John, the slacker, slacker, too lie ay***

We'll work tomorrow but no work today\
***John, the slacker, slacker, too lie ay***\
We'll work tomorrow but no work today\
***John, the slacker, slacker, too lie ay***

> ***Too lie ay, oh, to lie ay...***

We're bound away for 'Frisco Bay\
We're bound away at the break of day

We're bound away 'round Cape Horn\
We wish to Christ we'd never been born

Oh haul, oh haul, oh haul away\
Oh haul away and make your pay

And we are Liverpool born and bred\
We're strong in the arm but we're thick in the head
