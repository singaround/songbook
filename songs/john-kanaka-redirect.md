   This song isn't in our songbook, as the word 'kanaka' can be understood to be racially derogatory. However, we have two rewritten versions of it - (1) "[John the Slacker](https://www.auntieshanty.org/songs/john-the-slacker-slacker/)" - which is very similar to the original, but with a change of chorus, and (2) [Ben Kenobi Nobi](https://www.auntieshanty.org/songs/ben-kenobi-nobi/), a Star Wars themed version by Les Barker.
