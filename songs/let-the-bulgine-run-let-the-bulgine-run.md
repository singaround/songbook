description: >-
  In the 1840s, New York saw the emergence of a new urban youth culture among
  single working women. These 'Bowery gals' worked in factories, in shops, or as
  seamstresses, and enjoyed spending their wages after hours in theatres, dance
  halls and ice-cream parlours. They were known for wearing brightly-coloured
  clothes and walking out together on the pavements of The Bowery, New York's
  oldest street.

Oh, the smartest packet you can find,\
Ah Hey! Ah Ho! Are you most done?\
Is the Old Wild Cat of the Swallowtail Line!\
***Clear away the track, and let the bulgine run!***

> ***Timme Hey, Rig-a-jig, and a jaunting run!***\
> ***Ah Hey! Ah Ho! Are you most done?***\
> ***With Liza Lee all on my knee,***\
> ***Clear away the track, and let the bulgine run!***

Oh! the Old Wildcat of the Swallowtail Line,\
Ah Hey! Ah Ho! Are you most done?\
She's never a day behind her time!\
***Clear away the track, and let the bulgine run!***

> ***Timme Hey, Rig-a-jig, and a jaunting run...***

Oh, we're outward bound for New York Town,\
Them Bowery gals we'll waltz around.

> ***Timme Hey, Rig-a-jig, and a jaunting run...***

When we've stowed our freight at the West Street Pier,\
It's home to Liverpool then we'll steer.

> ***Timme Hey, Rig-a-jig, and a jaunting run...***

When I come home from across the sea,\
Eliza said she'll marry me.

> ***Timme Hey, Rig-a-jig, and a jaunting run...***
> 
When we all gets back to Liverpool town,\
I'll stand ye whiskies all around.

> ***Timme Hey, Rig-a-jig, and a jaunting run...***

I'll stay with Liza on the shore\
And it's back to sea I'll go no more.

> ***Timme Hey, Rig-a-jig, and a jaunting run...***
> ***Timme Hey, Rig-a-jig, and a jaunting run...***
