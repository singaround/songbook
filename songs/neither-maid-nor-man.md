>***Neither man nor maid am I,\
I’m neither maid nor man,\
To weave or drum, to sail or fight,\
I’ll prove to you I can,\
I’ll show you who I am.***

**Verse 1 - Handsome Cabin Boy**
First the tale of a handsome girl as you may understand,
Her mind was bent on rambling into some foreign land.
She dressed herself in sailor’s clothes or so it did appear,
And she hired with a captain bold to serve him for a year.
To serve him for a year.
 
>***Neither man nor maid...***

*V2 Bold William Taylor - extracts/rewrite*
Next the tale of Sally wise, her heart was filled with woe,
Her William had enlisted, for a soldier he did go.
She dressed herself in man’s array, she cut her flowing hair
And showed the world all over that a soldier can be fair.
A soldier can be fair.

>***Neither man nor maid...***

****V3 Handsome Cabin Boy v1 rewrite**
Thirdly of a pretty lad who would not beat the drum,
Adorned himself in garments gay, to London he did come.
Then he became apprenticed to a tailor proud and true,
To work the weft into the warp and dress the finest few.
To dress the finest few.

>***Neither man nor maid...***

*V4 Alex*
When I was approaching the age of twenty-five.
From my heart I took a vow; the truth for all my life,
I threw away my clothes and all, of gender I did speak,
Neither maid nor man am I and some call me a freak.
Yet others call me free.
