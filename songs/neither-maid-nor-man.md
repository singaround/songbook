description:    In October 2023, the folk trio Tarren spent a week at Cecil Sharp House in London researching traditional songs and creating new music celebrating gender non-conformity in folk music. The result of their residency was the song, ‘Neither Maid nor Man’.
In an article on the TradFolk website, Danny Pedler from Tarren explains the background to the song.
"Folk music is a living tradition; it lives through reinterpretations and additions. Our song ‘Neither Maid nor Man’ aims to introduce stories of gender non-conformity into the folk canon. The first three verses are slightly rewritten versions of ‘The Female Cabin Boy’ and ‘William Taylor’ to reflect our research into the ‘warrior woman’ song type. We then introduce a story of our own Alex Garden coming out as non-binary in the 21st century."

>***Neither man nor maid am I,\
I’m neither maid nor man,\
To weave or drum, to sail or fight,\
I’ll prove to you I can,\
I’ll show you who I am.***

First the tale of a handsome girl as you may understand,\
Her mind was bent on rambling into some foreign land.\
She dressed herself in sailor’s clothes or so it did appear,\
And she hired with a captain bold to serve him for a year.\
To serve him for a year.
 
>***Neither man nor maid...***

Next the tale of Sally wise, her heart was filled with woe,\
Her William had enlisted, for a soldier he did go.\
She dressed herself in man’s array, she cut her flowing hair\
And showed the world all over that a soldier can be fair.\
A soldier can be fair.

>***Neither man nor maid...***

Thirdly of a pretty lad who would not beat the drum,\
Adorned himself in garments gay, to London he did come.\
Then he became apprenticed to a tailor proud and true,\
To work the weft into the warp and dress the finest few.\
To dress the finest few.

>***Neither man nor maid...***

When I was approaching the age of twenty-five.\
From my heart I took a vow; the truth for all my life,\
I threw away my clothes and all, of gender I did speak,\
Neither maid nor man am I and some call me a freak.\
Yet others call me free.
