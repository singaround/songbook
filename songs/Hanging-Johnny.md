  With a double pull, this shanty was probably used for the halyard or a long
  drag. A classic example of a 'stringing-out' shanty - one where the shanty
  singer could make up as many verses as required to get the job done. Sung at a
  session, it's important to read the room and think carefully about how many
  verses to include if there are lots of people who would like a sing - it would
  be totally historically in keeping to shorten (or even lengthen!) the song to
  match the occasion.

They call me hanging Johnny,

> _Away, boys, away!_

They say I hang for money!

> _So hang, boys, hang down!_

They say I hanged my mother,\
My sisters and my brothers

They say I hanged my granny,\
I strung her up so canny

They say I hung a copper,\
I gave him the long dropper

I'd hang the mates and skippers,\
I'd hang 'em by their flippers

A rope, a beam, a ladder,\
I'll hang ye all together

Hang 'em from the yardarm,\
Hang the sea and buy a pigfarm

They say I hang for money,\
I hang because it's funny

They call me hanging Johnny,\
Ain't never hanged nobody
