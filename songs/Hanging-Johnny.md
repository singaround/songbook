description: >-
  With a double pull, this shanty was probably used for the halyard or a long
  drag. A classic example of a 'stringing-out' shanty - one where the shanty
  singer could make up as many verses as required to get the job done. Sung at a
  session, it's important to read the room and think carefully about how many
  verses to include if there are lots of people who would like a sing - it would
  be totally historically in keeping to shorten (or even lengthen!) the song to
  match the occasion.

They call me hanging Johnny,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
They say I hang for money!\
***So hang, boys, hang!***

They say I hanged my mother,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
My sisters and my brothers\
***So hang, boys, hang!***

They say I hanged my granny,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
I strung her up so canny\
***So hang, boys, hang!***

They say I hung a copper,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
I gave him the long dropper\
***So hang, boys, hang!***

I'd hang the mates and skippers,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
I'd hang 'em by their flippers\
***So hang, boys, hang!***

A rope, a beam, a ladder,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
I'll hang ye all together\
***So hang, boys, hang!***

Hang 'em from the yardarm,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
Hang the sea and buy a pigfarm\
***So hang, boys, hang!***

They say I hang for money,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
I hang because it's funny\
***So hang, boys, hang!***

They call me hanging Johnny,\
**Away, boys, away!**\
Ain't never hanged nobody\
***So hang, boys, hang!***
