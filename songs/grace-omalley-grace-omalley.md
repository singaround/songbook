Now in sailor's clothes Granuaile did go\
A bold sea captain from top to toe\
Her clans and children were the greatest care of \
Grace O'Malley\
of Grace O'Malley who never did despair\
\
Her trade was maintenanced by land and sea\
200 loyal men were her army\
No other captain was so skilled or brave as \
Grace O'Malley\
as Grace O'Malley who ruled the stormy waves

They had not sailed far from Clew Bay\
When she spied a vessel bound for Galway\
"Those are sea merchants!" Granua did cry and \
Granuaile \
And Granuaile will stop that ship or die

She stopped that ship and they took its store\
She returned to old Erin's shore\
With Spanish brandy she walked along did \
Granuaile\
Did Granuaile, who sweetly sang a song 

Queen Elizabeth did once suggest\
That she would make Grace a countess\
"Oh no" said Grace, "That would never do for \
Grace O'Malley\
For Grace O'Malley is as great a queen as you."

A queen uncommon by land and sea\
Her strength commanded fierce loyalty\
Her wealth provided for many's the clans of\
Grace O'Malley\
Grace O'Malley, sea woman of Ireland
