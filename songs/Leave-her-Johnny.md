description: >-
  This shanty had a famous function as the last song of the voyage. Once the ship was warping in through the locks or sailing down the river to approach the pier   head the shanty singer would let rip with this song, finally airing months of pent up frustrations.  As such, every time this song was sung would have been different to match the specific anger of the ship.   
  The verses listed below are ***not*** a command, and if you
  sang them all you'd be here a very long while. Rather, pick and choose your
  favourites. Or better still, write some yourself about whatever's grinding
  your gears - the patriarchy, the government, rival pubs, viola players etc.

I thought I heard the Old Man say\
***Leave her, Johnny, leave her***\
You can go ashore and take your pay\
***And it's time for us to leave her***

>***Leave her, Johnny, leave her***\
***Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her***\
***For the voyage is done and the winds don't blow***\
***And it's time for us to leave her***

Oh her stern was foul and the voyage was long\
***Leave her, Johnny, leave her***\
The winds was bad and the gales was strong\
***And it's time for us to leave her***

>***Leave her, Johnny...***

Oh the times was hard and the wages low\
***Leave her, Johnny, leave her***\
And the grub was bad and the gales did blow\
***And it's time for us to leave her***

>***Leave her, Johnny...***

Oh the Captain swears and the mate does too\
***Leave her, Johnny, leave her***\
If you were there then you'd swear too\
***And it's time for us to leave her***

>***Leave her, Johnny...***

We swear by rote for want of more,\
***Leave her, Johnny, leave her***\
But now we're through and go to shore\
***And it's time for us to leave her***

>***Leave her, Johnny...***

It's pump or drown, the old man said,\
***Leave her, Johnny, leave her***\
Or else, by Christ, we'll all be dead\
***And it's time for us to leave her***

>***Leave her, Johnny...***

And now it's time to say goodbye\
***Leave her, Johnny, leave her***\
For the old pierhead's a-drawing nigh\
***And it's time for us to leave her***

**==== SUGGESTED END ====**\
**[some potential other verses listed below if you'd like to extend it]**

No more Cape Horn, no more stand by,\
We'll pump 'er out and we'll leave 'er dry.

And the captain was bad but the mate was worse,\
He could blow you down with a sigh and a curse

Oh the wind was foul and the sea ran high,\
She shipped it green and none went by.

Oh the wind was foul, all work, no pay,\
To Liverpool docks from Frisco Bay.

There's maggots in the beef and grubs in the bread,\
I wish the quartermaster was dead

We'd be better off in a nice clean gaol,\
Will all night in and plenty of ale.

She's poverty-stricken and parish-rigged,\
And the bloomin' crowd is fever-stricked.

Oh the rats are gone and we the crew,\
It's damned high time we left 'er too.
