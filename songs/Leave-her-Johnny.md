  This shanty could be used at the pumps or the capstan, but had a more famous
  function as the last song of the voyage. Shantysingers had protected status on
  the ship compared to other sailors. Although they were a non ranking sailor,
  they made the ship far more efficient and were the main source of
  entertainment for the long months of sailing. They were in sufficiently short
  supply and sufficiently important that they could criticise the ship without
  being punished. Throughout the voyages, their fellow sailors would share their
  objections to any aspect of the journey - the destination, the food, the
  captain and other officers. Once the ship was warping in through the locks or
  sailing down the river to approach the pier head the shanty singer would let
  rip with this song, finally airing months of pent up frustrations.  As such,
  every time this song was sung would have been different to match the specific
  anger of the ship. The verses listed below are ***not*** a command, and if you
  sang them all you'd be here a very long while. Rather, pick and choose your
  favourites. Or better still, write some yourself about whatever's grinding
  your gears - the patriarchy, the government, rival pubs, viola players etc.

I thought I heard the Old Man say\
***Leave her, Johnny, leave her***\
You can go ashore and take your pay\
***And it's time for us to leave her***\
\
***Leave her, Johnny, leave her***\
***Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her***\
***For the voyage was long and the winds did blow***\
***And it's time for us to leave her***\
\
Oh her stern was foul and the voyage was long\
The winds was bad and the gales was strong

Oh the times was hard and the wages low\
And the grub was bad and the gales did blow

Oh the Captain swears and the mate does too,\
If you were there then you'd swear too

We swear by rote for want of more,\
But now we're through and go to shore

Oh God I hate this fucking tub,\
It's a rotten ship with rotten grub,

It's pump or drown, the old man said,\
Or else, by Christ, we'll all be dead.

No more Cape Horn, no more stand by,\
We'll pump 'er out and we'll leave 'er dry.

Oh a dollar a day is Jack shite pay,\
To pump all night and pump all day

And the captain was bad but the mate was worse,\
He could blow you down with a sigh and a curse

Oh the wind was foul and the sea ran high,\
She shipped it green and none went by.

Oh the wind was foul, all work, no pay,\
To Liverpool docks from Frisco Bay.

There's maggots in the beef and grubs in the bread,\
I wish the quartermaster was dead

We'd be better off in a nice clean gaol,\
Will all night in and plenty of ale.

She's poverty-stricken and parish-rigged,\
And the bloomin' crowd is fever-stricked.

Oh how I hate Theresa May,\
When she's booted out I'll sing 'hurray'

Oh the rats are gone and we the crew,\
It's damned high time we left 'er too.

And now it's time to say goodbye\
For the old pierhead's a-drawing nigh
