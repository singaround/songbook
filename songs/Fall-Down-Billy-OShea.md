description: >-
  This shanty tells the common story of being pressed. Between 1664 and 1814,
  impressment was used to fill the crews of British navy ships. Any man between
  18 and 55 with sailing ability could be pressed into service by the Navy
  Impressment Service, known as 'The Press Gang'. The punishment for refusing
  was hanging.

We all got drunk in Dublin city\
***Fall down me Billy***\
We all got drunk, sure more's the pity\
***Fall down Billy O'Shea***

> ***Fall down, fall down, fall down me Billy\
We're bound away for Americay\
Fall down Billy O'Shea***

We lay ourselves down on Sir Rogerson's Quay\
***Fall down me Billy***\
And when we woke we were out to sea\
***Fall down Billy O'Shea***

> ***Fall down, fall down...***

We are not sailors captain dear\
***Fall down me Billy***\
We come from the land and we won't work here\
***Fall down Billy O'Shea***

> ***Fall down, fall down...***

Says the captain, "I've a cure for that"\
***Fall down me Billy***\
"And here for a start is a dose of the cat"\
***Fall down Billy O'Shea***

> ***Fall down, fall down, fall down me Billy\
We're bound away for Americay\
Fall down Billy O'Shea***

Well sent him up to the top-mast yard\
***Fall down me Billy***\
And when he hit the deck, well he took it hard\
***Fall down Billy O'Shea***

> ***Fall down, fall down...***

So we wrapped him in the Captain's sail\
***Fall down me Billy***\
And lowered him gently o'er the rail\
***Fall down Billy O'Shea***

> ***Fall down, fall down...***

Over the side and down he goes\
***Fall down me Billy***\
Down to Davy Jones with a stitch through his nose\
***Fall down Billy O'Shea***

> ***Fall down, fall down...***

Oh and as he went I heard him say\
***Fall down me Billy***\
I thought we were bound for Americay\
***Fall down Billy O'Shea***

> ***Fall down, fall down...***
