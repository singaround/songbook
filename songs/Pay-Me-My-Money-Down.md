I thought I heard our captain say\
***Pay me my money down***\
Tomorrow is our sailing day\
***Pay me my money down***

>***Pay me, Oh pay me\
Pay me my money down\
Pay me or go to jail\
Pay me my money down***

Soon as the boat was clear of the bar\
He knocked me down with the end of a spar

>***Pay me, Oh pay me...***

I wish I was Mr Howard's son\
Sit in the house and drink strong rum

>***Pay me, Oh pay me...***

I wish I was Ms Steven's son\
Sit on the bank and watch the work done

>***Pay me, Oh pay me...***

I wish I was Mr Dexter's daughter\
Sit in the shade and drink fine porter

>***Pay me, Oh pay me...***

I wish I was Mr Pullmans's child\
Sit in the pub and drink good mild

>***Pay me, Oh pay me...***
