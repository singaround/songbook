Aft on the Poopdeck\
Walking about\
There is the Second Mate\
So sturdy and so stout\
What he is thinking of\
He only knows himself\
Oh, we wish that he would hurry up\
And **strike, strike the bell**

> ***Strike the bell, Second Mate***\
> ***Let us go below***\
> ***Look away to windward***\
> ***You can see it's going to blow***\
> ***Look at the glass***\
> ***You can see that it is fell***\
> ***We wish the you would hurry up***\
> ***And strike, strike the bell***

Down on the maindeck\
Working at the pumps\
There is the larboard watch\
Ready for their bunks\
Over to windward\
They see a great swell\
They're wishing that the Second Mate\
Would **strike, strike the bell**

> ***Strike the bell, Second Mate...***

Aft at the wheel\
Poor Anderson stands\
Grasping the spokes\
In his cold, mittened hands\
Looking at the compass\
The course is clear as hell\
He's wishing that the Second Mate\
Would **strike, strike the bell**

> ***Strike the bell, Second Mate...***

For'ad in the fo'c'sle head\
Keeping sharp lookout\
There is Johnny standing\
Ready for to shout\
"lights' burning bright, Sir\
And everything is well"\
He's wishing that the Second Mate\
Would **strike, strike the bell**

> ***Strike the bell, Second Mate...***

Aft the quarterdeck\
The gallant Captain stands\
Looking to windward\
With his glasses in his hand\
What he is thinking of\
We know very well\
He's thinking more of shortening sail\
Than **strike, strike the bell**

> ***Strike the bell, Second Mate...***
