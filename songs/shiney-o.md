Captain, captain, you are a dandy\
***Way-ay-ay-ay, shiny-o***\
Captain, captain, you love your brandy\
***Way-ay-ay-ay, shiny-o***

Won’t you ferry me over to Dover\
***Way-ay-ay-ay, shiny-o***\
Won’t you ferry me over to Dover\
***Way-ay-ay-ay, shiny-o***

Queenstown to Dover’s a hundred miles or over\
***Way-ay-ay-ay, shiny-o***\
Queenstown to Dover’s a hundred miles or over\
***Way-ay-ay-ay, shiny-o***

Captain, captain, how deep is the water?\
It measures six feet, one inch and a quarter

Captain, captain, I love your daughter\
Captain, captain, I love your daughter

Shiny-o is the captain’s daughter\
For her I’d sail our over the water

Rivers, rivers, rivers are a-rolling\
Rivers are a-rolling and I can’t get over

Captain, captain, you are a dandy\
Captain, captain, you love your brandy
