Some's loading at 'frisco with cargoes of grain\
Or Oregon timber in the fog and the rain\
But we're loading nitrate at old iquique\
And the girls have a got a hold of our tow rope today

***Goodbye Serafina, Rosita and Luz,***\
***The girls on the tow rope are steady and true,***\
***Mothers and sisters and sweethearts and all,***\
***It's haul away! All the way! Haul away haul!***

The last sack of nitrate is stowed down at last\
The southern cross burns at the head of the mast\
We'll sing fare thee well as we get under way\
For the girls have got a hold of our tow rope today

We're rounding the horn with our gallants all set\
Our lee rail is under, we're cursing, you bet\
But the old man's a driver he'll brook no delay\
For the girls have got a hold of our tow rope today

Cape stiff is behind us blue waters beneath\
Our wake's like a millrace and bone in her teeth\
We've entered the trades now, we'll soon make her pay\
For the girls have got a hold of our tow rope today

The mate's on the poop deck a-shootin the sun\
He'll soon be deducing how far the ship's run\
Let's crack the old hooker and get on our way\
For the girls have got a hold of our tow rope today

At last we're in harbour the rags are all furled\
The girl's are all waiting, we're on top of the world\
That'll do cries the mate. Now it's fourteen month's pay\
And the girls have got a hold of our tow rope today.
