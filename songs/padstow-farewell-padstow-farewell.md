It’s time to go now\
Haul away your anchor\
***Haul away your anchor\
It’s our sailing time***

Get some sail upon her\
Haul away your halyards\
***Haul away your halyards\
It’s our sailing time***

Get her on her course now\
Haul away your foresheets\
***Haul away your foresheets\
It’s our sailing time***

Waves are surging under\
Haul away down Channel\
***Haul away down Channel\
On the evening tide***

When your sailing’s over\
Haul away for Heaven\
***Haul away for Heaven\
God be by your side***

It’s time to go now\
Haul away your anchor\
***Haul away your anchor\
It’s our sailing time***
