  This is a sad forebitter about a sailor who unhappily returns to sea.
---
When first I landed in Liverpool, I went upon a spree\
While money lasts I spent it fast, got drunk as drunk could be\
And when me money was all gone, 'twas then I wanted more\
But I'd made up my mind that I was inclined to go to sea no more

***No more, no more, I'll go to sea no more***\
***I'd made up my mind that I was inclined to go to sea no more***

As I was walking down the street I met with Angeline.\
She said: “Come home with me, my lad, and we'll have a cracking time.”\
But when I awoke, it was no joke, I found I was all alone.\
My silver watch and my money too, and my whole bloody gear was gone.

***Was gone, was gone! My whole bloody gear was gone.***\
***When I awoke, it was no joke for my whole bloody gear was gone.***

As I was walking down the street I met big Rapper Brown.\
I asked him if he would take me in, and he looked at me with a frown.\
He said, “Last time you was paid off, with me you chalked up no score,\
But I'll take your advance and I'll give youse a chance to go to sea once more.”

***"Once more, once more! To go to sea once more.***\
***I'll take your advance and I'll give youse a chance to go to sea once more.”***

He shipped me on board of a whaling ship bound for the Arctic seas,\
Where cold winds blow and there's frost and snow and Jamaica rum would freeze.\
And worse to bear, I'd no hard-weather gear, for I'd lost all my dunnage ashore.\
It was then that I wished that I was dead so I'd go to sea no more.

***No more, no more! I'd go to sea no more.***\
***It was then that I wished that I was dead so I'd go to sea no more.***

Sometimes we're catching whales, my lads, but mostly we get none,\
With a twenty-foot oar in every paw from five o'clock in the morn.\
And when daylight's gone and the night coming on, you rest upon your oar,\
And oh boys, you wish that you was dead or snug with the girls ashore.

***Ashore, ashore! Snug with the girls ashore.***\
***Oh boys, you wish that you was dead or snug with the girls ashore.***

Come all you bold seafaring lads that listen to my song.\
Now it's when you come off them long trips, I'll have you not go wrong.\
Take my advice, drink no strong drink, but lay up your money in store,\
Get married my boys and spend all night in bed and go to sea no more.

***No more, no more! Don't go to sea no more.***\
***Get married my boys and spend all night in bed and go to sea no more.***
