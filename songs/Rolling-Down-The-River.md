I once was a rigger and I worked like hell\
***Rolling up, rolling down!***\
And now I’m a sailor with the OCL\
***I go rolling down the river!***

>***Rolling up! rolling down!\
We’ll all get drunk in Tilbury town,\
Twenty-four hours we’ll turn around\
And go rolling down the river***

Now the work is good and the wages fine\
***Rolling up, rolling down!***\
When you make a trip in a container line\
***And go rolling down the river!***

>***Rolling up! rolling down...***

Now the cargo comes in TEUs\
***Rolling up, rolling down!***\
That’s a twenty-foot box, boys, full of booze\
***To go rolling down the river!***

>***Rolling up! rolling down...***

When first I saw a TEU\
***Rolling up, rolling down!***\
I wondered where they stowed the crew\
***To go rolling down the river!***

>***Rolling up! rolling down!\
We’ll all get drunk in Tilbury town,\
Twenty-four hours we’ll turn around\
And go rolling down the river***

Now we’re the boys to sail ’em through
***Rolling up, rolling down!***\
To hell with the channel and the TEUs!\
***We'll go rolling down the river!***

>***Rolling up! rolling down...***
