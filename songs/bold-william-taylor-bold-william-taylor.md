Billy Taylor, youthful lover,\
Full of love and loyalty,\
Just as he was to get married\
Pressed he was and sent to sea.

But the bride soon followed after\
Under the name of Richard Carr:\
Snow-white fingers long and slender,\
All covered over wi' pitch and tar.

She's buttoned on the sailor's clothing,\
Dressed herself up like a man;\
Away she sailed like a tarry sailor\
All aboard the Mary Anne.

One day in the heat of battle,\
Shot and shell were flying there.\
Silver button flew off her waistcoat,\
Left her lily-white breast quite bare.

When the captain did discover\
He said "Fair maid, what brought you here?"\
"Sir, I‘m seeking William Taylor.\
Pressed he was by you last year."

“If Billy Taylor's your true lover,\
He has proved to you untrue;\
He's got married to another,\
Left ye here alone to rue."

“Rise ye early in the morning,\
Early by the break o' day,\
There you'll see young Billy Taylor\
Walking out with his lady gay.”

She rose early the next morning,\
Early by the break o' day,\
There she saw young Billy Taylor\
Walking out with his lady gay.

Gun and pistol she's commanded,\
Gun and pistol by her side;\
She has shot young Billy Taylor\
Walking out with his new-made bride.

“Now,” says the captain, “My fair lady,\
Come tell me what you've done.”\
“I have shot young Billy Taylor\
With a double-barrelled gun.”

When the captain did behold her\
And the deed that she had done,\
He did make her chief commander\
Over a ship and a hundred men.
