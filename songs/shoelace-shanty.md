On the transatlantic routes\
When you’re lacing up your boots\
***Shout the shanty loud and haul away***

And on a deep sea ocean cruise\
When you’re putting on your shoes\
***Shout the shanty loud and haul away***

And if you're hauling on the braces\
Or just tightening your laces\
***Shout the shanty loud and haul away***

>***Cos if there’s rope or cord or string\
You’ll be sure to hear us sing\
Shout the shanty loud and haul away***

If you’re sailing through the German Bight\
Or turning off the bathroom light\
***Shout the shanty loud and haul away***

>***Cos if there’s rope...***

While you ride upon the ocean’s swells\
Or when you ring out the wedding bells\
***Shout the shanty loud and haul away***

>***Cos if there’s rope...***

When you sail with Captain Hornblower\
Or start a petrol lawnmower\
***Shout the shanty loud and haul away***

>***Cos if there’s rope...***

As I sight the coast of Dorset\
While I’m lacing up my corset\
***I shout the shanty loud and haul away***

>***Cos if there’s rope...***

When a winter storm is guaranteed\
When you unspool an extension lead\
***Shout the shanty loud and haul away***

>***Cos if there’s rope...***

If you’re sailing down to Hilo\
Or playing with a yo-yo\
***Shout the shanty loud and haul away***

>***Cos if there’s rope...***

When I sail the ship across the bar\
Or change the strings of my guitar\
***Shout the shanty loud and haul away***

>***Cos if there’s rope...***

[tragically]\
And when at last the glass is fell\
And when they sound my funeral knell\
***They'll shout the shanty loud and haul away***

>***Cos if there’s rope...***
 
Away, haul away,\
We’re all bound away\
***Shout the shanty loud, haul away***
