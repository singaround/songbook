  The passenger steamer Dandenong was shipwrecked off the coast of Jervis Bay in
  1876 on the way from Melbourne to Newcastle, New South Wales. Forty out of
  eighty-three passengers were lost in the wreck.
---
Oh wild and furious blew the blast,\
And the clouds were hangin' round\
When the Dandenong from Melbourne sailed\
To Newcastle port was bound\
She had eighty three poor souls on board\
Through the storm she cleaved her way\
Well it's sad to relate her terrible fate\
Was just off Jervis bay

> ***And I dream of you, I dream of sleep***\
> ***I dream of bein' warm***\
> ***But through the night I have to sail***\
> ***To brave this raging storm***

While steering through the briny waves,\
A propelling shaft gave way\
And the waters they came crashing in\
Which filled us with dismay\
All hands on board did all they could\
'Till at length all hope was gone\
And they hoisted a signal of distress\
On board of the Dandenong\
\
It was not long until a barque\
Of a brisk and lively crew\
Came bearing down and the Captain cried,\
"We'll see what we can do!"\
Came bearing down with might and main\
In spite of land or wave\
They did all they could as sailors would\
Those precious lives to save

> ***And I dream of you, I dream of sleep***\
> ***I dream of bein' warm***\
> ***And pray the sea will leave me be***\
> ***To see another dawn***

Now some in boats they tried to reach\
That kind and friendly barque\
And numbers of their lives were saved\
But the night came on pitch dark\
What mortal man then could do more\
When the storm increased on strong\
And the rest now sleep in the briny deep\
Along with the Dandenong

> ***And I dream of you, I dream of sleep***\
> ***I dream of comin' home***\
> ***But a mile of water buries me***\
> ***Beneath this ragin' foam***
>
> ***And I dream of you, I dream of sleep***\
> ***I dream of bein' warm***\
> ***But through the night I have to sail***\
> ***To brave this raging storm***
