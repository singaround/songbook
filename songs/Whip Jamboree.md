And now my lads be of good cheer

For the Irish Coast will soon draw near

And we'll set a course for The Old Cape Clear

Jenny get your Oatcakes done

Whip Jamboree, whip Jamboree

Oh you pig-tailed sailor hanging down behind

Whip Jamboree, Whip Jamboree

Oh Jenny get your Oatcakes done

And now Cape Clear it is in sight

We'll be off Holyhead by tomorrow night

And we'll steer a course for The Old Rock Light

Jenny get your Oatcakes done

And now m'lads we're off Holyhead

No more salt beef or weevily bread

One man in the chains for to heave the Lead

Jenny get your Oatcakes done

And now we're rounding Fort Perch Rock

All hammocks lashed and sea-chests locked

We'll haul her into Waterloo Dock

Jenny get your Oatcakes done

And now my lads we're all in dock

We'll be off to Dan Lowry's on The Spot

And there we'll sup A Big Pint Pot

Jenny get your Oatcakes done
