It was a Friday morn when we set sail\
And we were not far from the land\
When our captain, he spied a fishy mermaid\
With a comb and a glass in her hand

> ***Oh the ocean waves do roll\
And the stormy winds do blow\
And we poor sailors are skipping at the top\
While the landlubbers lie down below, below, below\
While the landlubbers lie down below***

Now the song she sang, she sang so sweet,\
No answer at all could I say\
Till our gallant ship she swung round about\
Which made our poor hearts to ache

> ***Oh the ocean waves do roll...***

Up spoke the captain of our gallant ship\
And a brave old skipper was he\
"This fishy mermaid has warned me of our doom\
We shall sink to the bottom of the sea"

> ***Oh the ocean waves do roll...***

Up spoke the first mate of our gallant ship\
And a well-spoken man was he\
"I have me a wife in Salem by the sea\
And tonight she a widow will be"

> ***Oh the ocean waves do roll...***

Up spoke the cook of our gallant ship\
And a greasy old butcher was he\
"I care much more for my pots and my pans\
Than I do for the bottom of the sea"

> ***Oh the ocean waves do roll...***

Then up spoke the cabin boy, of our gallant ship\
And a nasty little lad was he\
"I'm not quite sure I can spell mermaid\
But I'm going to the bottom of the sea"

> ***Oh the ocean waves do roll...***

Then up stepped the helmsman of our ship\
In his hand a lead and line\
For to sound the seas so wide and so deep\
No hard rock or sand could he find

> ***Oh the ocean waves do roll...***

Then three times around spun our gallant ship\
And three times around spun she\
Three times around spun our gallant ship\
And she sank to the bottom of the sea

> ***Oh the ocean waves do roll...***
