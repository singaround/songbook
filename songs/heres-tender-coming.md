Here's the tender coming, pressing all the men\
Oh dear hinny, what shall we do then?\
Here's the tender coming off at Shields Bar\
Here's the tender coming full of men of war

Hide thee canny hinny, hide thyself away\
Hide thee till the frigate makes for Druridge Bay\
If they take thee Geordie who's to win our bread?\
Me and little Jackie better off be dead

Here's the tender coming, stealing off my dear\
Oh dear hinny, they'll ship you out of here\
They will ship you foreign, that is what it means\
Here's the tender coming, full of red marines

Hey bonny lassie, let's go to the Lawe\
To see the tender lying off at Shields Bar\
With her colours flying, anchor at her bow\
They took my bonny laddie, best of all the crew

Here's the tender coming, pressing all the men\
Oh dear hinny, what shall we do then?\
Here's the tender coming off at Shields Bar\
Here's the tender coming full of men of war

Here's the tender, coming pressing all the men\
Oh dear hinny what shall we do then?
