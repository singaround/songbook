  A song about a sunken ship, but also about hope and common humanity,
  and triumph over adversity.


  This song has literally saved lives. On February 12, 1983 the ship Marine Electric
  was carrying a load of coal from Norfolk, Virginia to a power station in Somerset,
  Massachusetts. The worst storm in forty years blew up that night, and the ship sank
  at about four o'clock in the morning on February 13. The ship's chief mate, 
  59-year-old Robert M. "Bob" Cusick, was trapped in the deckhouse as the ship went
  down. His snorkeling experience helped him avoid panic and swim to the surface, but
  he was left to spend the night alone on a partially deflated lifeboat he eventually
  reached, in water barely above freezing and air much colder. Huge seas washed over
  him, and each time he was not sure that he would ever reach the surface again to
  breathe. Battling hypothermia, he was tempted to allow himself to fall unconscious
  and be washed away. Just then he remembered the concluding stanzas of "The Mary
  Ellen Carter".


  As Cusick tells in One Warm Line, a documentary about Rogers, he started to sing it
  and soon was alternately shouting out "Rise again, rise again" and holding his breath
  as the seas washed over him. At seven o'clock that morning a Coast Guard helicopter
  spotted him and pulled him to safety. Only three men of the thirty-four who had been
  aboard survived the wreck. After his ordeal, Cusick wrote a letter to Stan Rogers
  telling him what had happened and crediting the song with saving his life. In
  response, Rogers invited Cusick to attend what turned out to be the second-to-last
  concert Rogers ever performed. Cusick lived another 30 years, and his testimony and
  activism in the aftermath of the accident spurred far-reaching maritime safety reforms.

Oh, she went down last October in a pouring, driving rain\
The skipper, he'd been drinking, and the mate, he felt no pain\
How close to Three Mile Rock, and she was dealt her mortal blow\
Then the Mary Ellen Carter settled low\
There were just us four aboard her when she finally was awash\
We worked like hell to save her, all heedless of the cost\
But the groan she made as she went down, it caused us to proclaim\
That the Mary Ellen Carter'd rise again

> _Rise again, rise again!_\
> _May her name not be lost to the knowledge of men_\
> _All those who loved her best and who were with her till the end_\
> _Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!_

Well, the comp'ny wrote her off, not a nickel would they spend\
She gave 20 years of service, boys, and met a sorry end\
But insurance paid the loss to us, said "Let her rest below"\
Then they laughed at us, said we had to go\
But we talked of her all winter, sometimes days around the clock\
She's worth a quarter million afloatin' at the dock\
And with every jar that hit the bar we swore we would remain\
And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again

> _Rise again, rise again!_\
> _May her name not be lost to the knowledge of men_\
> _All those who loved her best and who were with her till the end_\
> _Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!_

All spring now we've been with her on a barge lent by a friend\
Three dives a day in a hard hat suit and twice I've had the bends\
Thank God it's only 60 feet and the currents here are slow\
Or I'd never have the strength to go below\
So we patched her rents, stopped her vents\
Dogged hatch and porthole down\
Put cables to her fore and aft and girded her around\
Tomorrow noon we'll hit the air and then take up the strain\
And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again

> _Rise again, rise again!_\
> _May her name not be lost to the knowledge of men_\
> _All those who loved her best and who were with her till the end_\
> _Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!_

Well, we couldn't leave her there, you see, to crumble into scale\
She'd saved our lives so many times fightin' through the gale\
And the laughing, drunken rats who led her to a sorry grave\
Well, they won't be laughing in another day\
And to you, for whom adversity has dealt its mortal blow\
We're smiling bastards lying to you everywhere you go\
Turn to and put out all your strength of arm and heart and brain\
And like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again

> _Rise again, rise again!_\
> _Though your heart it be broke and your life about to end_\
> _No matter what you lost, be it a home, a love, a friend_\
> _Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!_\
> _Rise again, rise again!_\
> _Though your heart it be broke and your life about to end_\
> _No matter what you lost, be it a home, a love, a friend_\
> _Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!_
