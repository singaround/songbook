When I was a fair maid about seventeen\
I enlisted in the Navy for to serve the queen\
I enlisted in the Navy a sailor for to stand\
For to hear the cannons rattling and the music so grand\
***The music so grand, the music so grand***\
***For to hear the cannons rattling and the music so grand***

The officer that enlisted me was a fine and handsome man\
He said You'll make a sailor so come along my lad\
My waist being tall and slender my fingers long and thin\
And the minute that they learned me I soon exceeded them\
***I soon exceeded them, I soon exceeded them***\
***Oh the minute that they learned me I soon exceeded them***

Well they sent me to my bunk and they sent me to my bed\
To lies with the sailors I never was afraid\
But taking off my bluecoat it often made me smile\
For to think I laid with a thousand men and a maiden all the while\
***A maiden all the while, a maiden all the while***\
***For to think I laid with a thousand men and a maiden all the while***

Well they sent me up to London for to guard the tower\
And surely might I been there till my very dying hour\
But a lady fell in love with me so I told her I was a maid\
Well she went up to my captain and my secret she betrayed\
***My secret she betrayed, my secret she betrayed***\
***She went up to my captain and my secret she betrayed***

The captain he came up to me and he asked if it was so\
I dare not I dare not I dare not say no\
A pity we should lose you such a sailor lad you made\
It's a pity we should lose you such a handsome young maid\
***A handsome young maid, a handsome young maid***\
***It's a pity we should lose you such a handsome young maid***

So fare thee well my captain you've been so kind to me\
And fare thee well my shipmates I must depart from thee\
But if the Navy ever needs a lad a sailor I'll remain\
I'll take off my hat and feathers and I'll run the rigging again\
***I'll run the rigging again, I'll run the rigging again***\
***I'll take off my hat and feathers and I'll run the rigging again***
