When I was a fair maid about seventeen
I enlisted in the Navy for to serve the queen
I enlisted in the Navy a sailor for to stand
For to hear the cannons rattling and the music so grand
>The music so grand, the music so grand
>For to hear the cannons rattling and the music so grand

The officer that enlisted me was a fine and handsome man
He said You'll make a sailor so come along my lad
My waist being tall and slender my fingers long and thin
And the minute that they learned me I soon exceeded them
>I soon exceeded them, I soon exceeded them
>Oh the minute that they learned me I soon exceeded them

Well they sent me to my bunk and they sent me to my bed
To lies with the sailors I never was afraid
But taking off my bluecoat it often made me smile
For to think I laid with a thousand men and a maiden all the while
>A maiden all the while, a maiden all the while
>For to think I laid with a thousand men and a maiden all the while

Well they sent me up to London for to guard the tower
And surely might I been there till my very dying hour
But a lady fell in love with me so I told her I was a maid
Well she went up to my captain and my secret she betrayed
>My secret she betrayed, my secret she betrayed
>She went up to my captain and my secret she betrayed

The captain he came up to me and he asked if it was so
I dare not I dare not I dare not say no
A pity we should lose you such a sailor lad you made
It's a pity we should lose you such a handsome young maid
>A handsome young maid, a handsome young maid
>It's a pity we should lose you such a handsome young maid

So fare thee well my captain you've been so kind to me
And fare thee well my shipmates I must depart from thee
But if the Navy ever needs a lad a sailor I'll remain 
I'll take off my hat and feathers and I'll run the rigging again
>I'll run the rigging again, I'll run the rigging again
>I'll take off my hat and feathers and I'll run the rigging again
