Now we are ready to head for the horn,\
***Weigh, hey, roll an' go!***\
Our boots an' our clothes boys are all in the pawn,\
***To me rollickin' Randy Dandy O!***

>***Heave a pawl, oh, heave away,\
Weigh, hey, roll and go!\
The anchor's on board an' the cable's all stored,\
To me rollickin' Randy Dandy O!***

Man the stout caps'n and heave with a will,\
***Weigh, hey, roll an' go!***\
For soon we'll be drivin' her 'way up the hill\
***To me rollickin' Randy Dandy O!***

>***Heave a pawl, oh, heave away...***

Heave away, bullies, ye parish-rigged bums,\
***Weigh, hey, roll an' go!***\
Take yer hands from yer pockets and don't suck yer thumbs\
***To me rollickin' Randy Dandy O!***

>***Heave a pawl, oh, heave away...***

We're outward bound for Vallipo bay,\
***Weigh, hey, roll an' go!***\
Get crackin', me lads, it's a hell of a way!\
***To me rollickin' Randy Dandy O!***

>***Heave a pawl, oh, heave away...***
