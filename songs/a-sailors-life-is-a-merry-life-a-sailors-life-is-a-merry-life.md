A sailor's life, it is a merry life\
He robs young girls of their heart's delight\
Leaving them behind to weep and mourn\
They never know when they will return

"Well, there's four and twenty all in a row\
My true love he makes the finest show\
He's proper, tall, genteel withal\
And if I don't have him, I'll have none at all"

"Oh, father build for me a bonny boat\
That on the wide ocean I may float\
And every Queen's ship that we pass by\
There I'll inquire for my sailor boy"

They had not sailed long upon the deep\
When a Queen's ship they chanced to meet\
"You sailors all, pray tell me true\
Does my sweet William sail among your crew?"\
\
"Oh no, fair maiden, he is not here\
For he's been drowned, we greatly fear\
On yon green island, as we passed it by\
There we lost sight of your sailing boy"

Well, she rung her hands and she tore her hair\
She was like a young girl in great despair\
And her little boat against a rock did run\
"How can I live now my sweet William's gone?
