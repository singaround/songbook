description: Written as part of an 'Access Folk' workshop, 2025. This song takes its inspiration from witches selling knotted strings to sailors. The knots were said to contain the wind, and by untying a knot the sailor could control the weather.

<span style="color:green">In my bag there is a knot\
I made upon the mountain\
In it there’s a winter gale\
To make the topsails fill\
I can better steer a ship\
Than any man alive can\
Or unknot a hurricane –\
Blow this old world away</span>

>***Or unknot a hurricane\
To blow this world away***

<span style="color:blue">What brings you to this sad place\
O Maid upon the mountain?</span>\
<span style="color:green">I have come to *wind* the wind\
In knots upon a string\
Take it down to Castle Town\
And sell the winds to sailors\
Gentle breeze or flowing gale\
Or storm in the unwinding</span>

>***Gentle breeze or flowing gale\
To blow this world away***

<span style="color:blue">I will carve an Irish flute\
To take the breath of sailors\
Sound the airs through tropic air\
A thousand miles away\
I will craft breath to a song\
of maids upon a mountain\
Fill the lungs of sailor men\
Who travel far from home</span>

>***Fill the lungs of sailor men\
To blow this world away***

<span style="color:purple">We have always plied this trade\
We maids upon the mountain\
We have always tied these knots\
To hold the winter gales</span>
<span style="color:green">Have you ever wondered why\
Some sails fill when seas are still?</span>\
<span style="color:purple">We weave knots of power\
And we weave them with the wind</span>

>***We weave knots of power\
To blow this world away***
