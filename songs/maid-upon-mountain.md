description: Written as part of an '[Access Folk](https://accessfolk.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/home)' workshop run by [Roary Skaista](https://roary.uk) in February 2025. This song takes its inspiration from the practice of [witches selling knotted strings to sailors](https://museumofwitchcraftandmagic.co.uk/object/knotted-rope/). The knots were said to contain the wind, and by untying a knot the sailor could control the weather.

<span style="color:green">In my bag there is a knot\
I made upon the mountain\
In it there’s a winter gale\
To make the topsails fill\
I can better steer a ship\
Than any man alive can\
Or unknot a hurricane –\
Blow this old world away</span>

>***Or unknot a hurricane\
To blow this world away***

<span style="color:blue">What brings you to this sad place\
O Maid upon the mountain?</span>\
<span style="color:green">I have come to *wind* the wind\
In knots upon a string\
Take it down to Castle Town\
And sell the winds to sailors\
Gentle breeze or flowing gale\
Or storm in the unwinding</span>

>***Gentle breeze or flowing gale\
To blow this world away***

<span style="color:blue">I will carve an Irish flute\
To take the breath of sailors\
Sound the airs through tropic air\
A thousand miles away\
I will craft breath to a song\
of maids upon a mountain\
Fill the lungs of sailor men\
Who travel far from home</span>

>***Fill the lungs of sailor men\
To blow this world away***

<span style="color:purple">We have always plied this trade\
We maids upon the mountain\
We have always tied these knots\
To hold the winter gales</span>
<span style="color:green">Have you ever wondered why\
Some sails fill when seas are still?</span>\
<span style="color:purple">We weave knots of power\
And we weave them with the wind</span>

>***We weave knots of power\
To blow this world away***
