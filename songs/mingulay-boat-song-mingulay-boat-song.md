> ***Hill-yo-ho, boys! Let her go, boys!***\
> ***Bring her head round, into the weather.***\
> ***Hill-yo-ho, boys! Let her go, boys,***\
> ***Sailing homeward to Mingulay.***

What care we though, white the Minch is?\
What care we for wind or weather?\
Pull her round, boys, every inch is\
Heading homeward to Mingulay.

> ***Hill-yo-ho, boys!...***

Wives are waiting at the pier head,\
looking seaward from the heather;\
They'll return though, when the sun sets\
They'll return to Mingulay.

> ***Hill-yo-ho, boys!...***

Ships return now, heavy laden,\
Mothers holding bairns a-crying.\
Let her go boys, and we'll anchor\
'Ere the sun sets on Mingulay.

> ***Hill-yo-ho, boys!...***
