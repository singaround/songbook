description: >-
  Mollymauk is another name for the albatross and one superstition was that the
  soul of a drowned sailor would fly forever as an albatross.


  There are a lot of songs that use 'he' by default, so we've switched the pronouns here, because why not?

Oh the southern ocean is a lonely place\
Where the storms are many and the shelter's scarce\
***Down upon the southern ocean sailing***\
***Down below Cape Horn***\
On the restless water and the troublin' skies\
You can see that mollymauk wheel and fly\
***Down upon the southern ocean sailing***\
***Down below Cape Horn***

>***Won't you ride the wind and go, white seabird\
Ride the wind and go, Mollymauk\
Down upon the southern ocean sailing\
Down below Cape Horn***

See the Mollymauk floatin' on her wide white wings\
And Lord, what a lonely song she sings\
***Down upon the southern ocean sailing***\
***Down below Cape Horn***\
And she's got no compass and she's got no gear\
And there's none can tell you how the Mollymauks steer\
***Down upon the southern ocean sailing***\
***Down below Cape Horn***

>***Won't you ride the wind...***

She's the ghost of a sailor-woman I've heard say\
Whose body sank, and her soul flew away\
***Down upon the southern ocean sailing***\
***Down below Cape Horn***\
And she's got no haven and she's got no home\
She's bound evermore for to wheel and roam\
***Down upon the southern ocean sailing***\
***Down below Cape Horn***

>***Won't you ride the wind...***

When I gets too weary for to sail no more\
Let my bones sink better far away from shore\
***Down upon the southern ocean sailing***\
***Down below Cape Horn***\
You can cast me loose and leave me driftin' free\
And I'll keep that big bird company\
***Down upon the southern ocean sailing***\
***Down below Cape Horn***

>***Won't you ride the wind...***
