Stormy's gone that good old man

Way. stormalong, John!

O, poor old Stormy's dead and gone,

Way hay, mister. Stormalong John!

We dug his grave with a silver spade,

His shroud of the finest silk was made.

We lowered him with a silver chain,

Our eyes all dim with more than rain.

An able sailor, bold and true,

A good old Bosun to his crew.

He's moored at last, and furled his sail,

No danger now from wreck or gale.

I wish I was old Stormy's son,

I'd build me a ship of a thousand ton.

I'd fill her up with New England rum,

And all my shellbacks they would have some.

I'd sail this wide world 'round and 'round,

With plenty of money I would be found.

Old Stormy's dead and gone to rest,

Of all the sailors he was the best.
