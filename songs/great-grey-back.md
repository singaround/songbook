Your great grey back seems so peaceful in the ocean\
***oo-oo-oo on the James Clark Ross***\
Here we come a-chasin' you and causing a commotion\
***look, there she blows with a hurry hurry-o\
On the James Clark Ross***

We sailed out of Immingham a-hoping for some fair winds\
***oo-oo-oo on the James Clark Ross***\
When we reached Ascension we were dancing with the penguins\
***look, there she blows with a hurry hurry-o\
On the James Clark Ross***

If I had my life again I'd be what Claire Waluda is\
***oo-oo-oo on the James Clark Ross***\
I'd quit the cosy pad-and-pen and be a penguin scientist\
***look, there she blows with a hurry hurry-o\
On the James Clark Ross***

Your great grey back seems to know just what the game is\
***oo-oo-oo on the James Clark Ross***\
I wish that I could talk to you, I'd ask you what your name is\
***look, there she blows with a hurry hurry-o\
On the James Clark Ross***

[Down at the bottom of the deep blue sea\
Catching fishes, one, two, three.]

Your great grey back seems so peaceful in the ocean\
***oo-oo-oo on the James Clark Ross***\
Here we come a-chasin' you and causing a commotion\
***look, there she blows with a hurry hurry-o\
On the James Clark Ross***
