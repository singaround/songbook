Safe and sound at home again\
Let the waters roar, Jack\
Safe and sound at home again\
Let the waters roar, Jack

> ***Long we've tossed on the rolling main***\
> ***Now we're safe ashore, Jack***\
> ***Don't forget your old shipmate***\
> ***Fal dee ral dee ral dee rye eye doe!***

Since we sailed from Plymouth Sound\
Four years gone, or nigh, Jack\
Was there ever chummies, now\
Such as you and I, Jack?

> ***Long we've tossed on the rolling main...***

We have worked the self-same gun:\
Quarterdeck division\
Sponger I and loader you\
Through the whole commission

> ***Long we've tossed on the rolling main...***

Oftentimes have we laid out\
toil nor danger fearing,\
Tugging out the flapping sail\
to the weather bearing

> ***Long we've tossed on the rolling main...***

When the middle watch was on\
And the time went slow, boy\
Who could choose a rousing stave\
Who like Jack or Joe, boy?

> ***Long we've tossed on the rolling main...***

There she swings, an empty hulk\
Not a soul below now\
Number seven starboard mess\
Misses Jack and Joe now

> ***Long we've tossed on the rolling main...***

But the best of friends must part\
Fair or foul the weather\
Hand yer flipper for a shake\
Now a drink together
