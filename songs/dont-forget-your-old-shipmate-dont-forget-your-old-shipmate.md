Safe and sound at home again

 __ Let the waters roar, Jack

Safe and sound at home again

  Let the waters roar, Jack



_Long we've tossed on the rolling main_

_Now we're safe ashore, Jack_

_Don't forget your old shipmate_

_Fal dee ral dee ral dee rye eye doe!_

__

Since we sailed from Plymouth Sound

  Four years gone, or nigh, Jack

Was there ever chummies, now

  Such as you and I, Jack?



_Long we've tossed on the rolling main_

_Now we're safe ashore, Jack_

_Don't forget your old shipmate_

_Fal dee ral dee ral dee rye eye doe!_



We have worked the self-same gun:

  Quarterdeck division

Sponger I and loader you

  Through the whole commission



_Long we've tossed on the rolling main..._

__

Oftentimes have we laid out

  toil nor danger fearing,

Tugging out the flapping sail

  to the weather bearing



_Long we've tossed on the rolling main..._



When the middle watch was on

  And the time went slow, boy

Who could choose a rousing stave

  Who like Jack or Joe, boy?



_Long we've tossed on the rolling main..._



There she swings, an empty hulk

  Not a soul below now

Number seven starboard mess

  Misses Jack and Joe now



_Long we've tossed on the rolling main..._



But the best of friends must part

  Fair or foul the weather

Hand yer flipper for a shake

  Now a drink together



_Long we've tossed on the rolling main..._
