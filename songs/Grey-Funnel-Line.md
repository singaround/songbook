  _Written by Cyril Tawney, this melancholy shanty reflects on his time in the
  Navy_: _'This was the last song I wrote before I left the Royal Navy in 1959.
  'The Grey Funnel Line' is the sailors' nickname for the Royal Navy-just as if
  it were another mercantile line. It's a straightforward song about a sailor
  leaving home and the loved one. He's extremely fed up with the Senior Service
  and he'd rather be outside, but he has to go away yet again. On occasions like
  this I think the close of the first day out, as the sun is setting, is the
  time when we're most vulnerable to nostalgia.'_

Don't mind the rain or the rolling sea\
The weary night never worries me\
But the hardest time in a sailor's day\
Is to watch the sun as it dies away\
***And it's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line***

The finest ship that sails the sea\
Is still a prison for the likes of me\
But give me wings like Noah's dove\
I'll fly up harbour to the girl I love\
***And it's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line***

There was a time my heart was free\
Like a floating spar on the open sea\
But now the spar is washed ashore\
It comes to rest at my real love's door\
***It's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line***

Every time I gaze behind the screws\
Makes me long for old Peter's shoes\
I'd walk right down that silver lane\
And take my love in my arms again\
***It's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line***

Oh Lord if dreams were only real\
I'd feel my hands on that wooden wheel\
And with all my heart I'd turn her round\
And tell the boys that we're homeward bound\
***And it's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line***

I'll pass the time like some machine\
Until the waters turn to green\
Then I'll dance on down that walk ashore\
***And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more***\
***And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more***
